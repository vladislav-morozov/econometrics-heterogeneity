## Course Content

### Short Description

Unobserved heterogeneity is pervasive in economics, driven by heterogeneous parameters and treatment effects, unobserved characteristics of agents, missing variables, etc. This class introduces methods for estimating parameters of interest in settings with such unobserved heterogeneity.

The course is structured into three main parts:

1. Linear models with heterogeneous coefficients
2. Nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity
3. Quantile and distributional treatment effects. Quantile and distributional regression methods.

This class focuses on observational cross-sectional and panel data settings.
