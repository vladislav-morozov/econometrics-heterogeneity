# Econometrics with Unobserved Heterogeneity â€“ Lecture Notes  

## Short Description

This repository contains lecture notes for the course *Econometrics with Unobserved Heterogeneity*, based on a topics course I delivered at the University of Bonn. The notes cover methods for handling unobserved heterogeneity in observational data, including:  

- Linear models with heterogeneous coefficients.
- Nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity.
- Quantile and distributional regression.
