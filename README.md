This repository contains lecture notes for the course *Econometrics with Unobserved Heterogeneity*, based on a graduate-level topics course I taught at the University of Bonn.

Causal inference with unobserved heterogeneity is the core challenge of empirical economics. Whether due to heterogeneous treatment effects, omitted confounders, or measurement error, unobserved factors create confounding in the data and require developing appropriate methods. This course surveys some modern identification strategies and estimation methods designed to recover causal relationships from observational data, where treatments are endogenously selected and key determinants of outcomes are hidden.



## Course Overview

**Instructor:** Vladislav Morozov\
**DOI**: 10.5281/zenodo.15459849\
**Level:** Second-year Master’s and PhD students; accessible to sufficiently prepared upper-level undergraduate students

The course is structured into three main parts:

- Linear models with heterogeneous coefficients.
- Nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity.
- Quantile and distributional regression.

## Learning Outcomes


By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Identify and explain different sources of unobserved heterogeneity in economic data.
- Apply econometric methods, such as heterogeneous coefficient models and quantile regression, to account for unobserved heterogeneity.
- Evaluate the trade-offs and assumptions underlying different modeling approaches in empirical research.
