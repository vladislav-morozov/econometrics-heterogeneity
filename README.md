# Econometrics with Unobserved Heterogeneity â€“ Lecture Notes  

## Short Description

This repository contains lecture notes for the course *Econometrics with Unobserved Heterogeneity*, based on a graduate-level topics course I taught at the University of Bonn.

These notes are published as a website using Quarto and are available online:

## Course Overview

Unobserved heterogeneity is a pervasive issue in economics â€” arising from agent-specific parameters, unmeasured covariates, and heterogeneous treatment effects. This course introduces econometric methods for estimating parameters of interest in settings with such heterogeneity, especially in observational cross-sectional and panel data contexts.

The course is structured into three main parts:

- Linear models with heterogeneous coefficients.
- Nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity.
- Quantile and distributional regression.

**Instructor:** Vladislav Morozov

**Level:** Second-year Masterâ€™s and PhD students; accessible to sufficiently prepared upper-level undergraduate students

## Learning Outcomes


By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Identify and explain different sources of unobserved heterogeneity in economic data.
- Apply econometric methods, such as heterogeneous coefficient models and quantile regression, to account for unobserved heterogeneity.
- Evaluate the trade-offs and assumptions underlying different modeling approaches in empirical research.
