This repository contains lecture notes for the course *Econometrics with Unobserved Heterogeneity*, based on a graduate-level topics course I taught at the University of Bonn.

Unobserved heterogeneity is a pervasive issue in economics — agent-specific parameters, unmeasured covariates, and heterogeneous treatment effects all provide example of unobserved differences. This course introduces econometric methods for estimating parameters of interest in settings with such heterogeneity, especially in observational cross-sectional and panel data contexts.


## Course Overview

**Instructor:** Vladislav Morozov\
**DOI**: 10.5281/zenodo.15459849\
**Level:** Second-year Master’s and PhD students; accessible to sufficiently prepared upper-level undergraduate students

The course is structured into three main parts:

- Linear models with heterogeneous coefficients.
- Nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity.
- Quantile and distributional regression.

## Learning Outcomes


By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Identify and explain different sources of unobserved heterogeneity in economic data.
- Apply econometric methods, such as heterogeneous coefficient models and quantile regression, to account for unobserved heterogeneity.
- Evaluate the trade-offs and assumptions underlying different modeling approaches in empirical research.
