### Short Description


Causal inference with unobserved heterogeneity is the core challenge of empirical economics. Whether due to heterogeneous treatment effects, omitted confounders, or measurement error, unobserved factors create confounding in the data and require developing appropriate methods. This course surveys some modern identification strategies and estimation methods designed to recover causal relationships from observational data, where treatments are endogenously selected and key determinants of outcomes are hidden.

The course is structured into three main parts:

1. Linear models with heterogeneous coefficients.
2. Nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity.
3. Quantile and distributional treatment effects and quantile and distributional regression methods.

We focus exclusively on observational cross-sectional and panel data, where unobserved heterogeneity cannot be ignored. The emphasis is on identification, rather than asymptotic theory or prediction.

### Course Materials

**Textbook:** None. This course is based on lecture notes and background articles, which are listed in the references.\
**Recommended Readings:** Please see the bibliography for a detailed reading list. 

 

### About These Notes

These lectures notes are based on a topics course I delivered at the University of Bonn. 
They are currently being uploaded in blocks as I organize and transform my notes. These notes are a work in progress. If you find any typos or have suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub using the link on the right!

Current version (February 10, 2026): the first two blocks are fully complete, with the third block in progress. Latest addition: introduction to quantile and distributional treatment effects, along with their identification.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Identify and explain different sources of unobserved heterogeneity in economic data.
- Apply econometric methods, such as heterogeneous coefficient models and quantile regression, to account for unobserved heterogeneity.
- Evaluate the trade-offs and assumptions underlying different modeling approaches in empirical research.
