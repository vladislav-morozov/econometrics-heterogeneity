# Nonparametric Identification of Quantile Treatment Effects under Unconfoundedness {#sec-qte-id-conf}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}

## Summary and Learning Outcomes

This section  

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

## Focus: Distributional Treatment Effects

We retain the (conditional) unconfoundedness assumption ([-@#eq-qte-unconf]).

$$
 \curl{Y_i^x}_x \independent X_i|W_i.
$$ 

### Parameters of Interest

The setting of @eq-qte-unconf is richer than that of @eq-qte-rct. It allows us to consider all of the unconditional and conditional QTEs and DTEs described in section [-@sec-qte-intro].  Specifically, we focus on the following parameters (in the order of identification):

1. QTE and DTE conditional on $W_i=w$ (@eq-qte-dfn-cond):
$$
\begin{align} 
DTE(x_1, x_2, y|w) & = F_{Y^{x_2}|W}(y|w) - F_{Y^{x_1}|W}(y|w).
\end{align}
$$
2. Unconditional QTE and DTE (@eq-qte-dfn-uncond):
$$
\begin{aligned} 
DTE(x_1, x_2, y) & = F_{Y^{x_2}}(y) - F_{Y^{x_1}}(y). 
\end{aligned}
$$
3. QTE and DTE conditional on $X_i=x_3$ (@eq-qte-dfn-cond-treat):
$$
\begin{align} 
	DTE(x_1, x_2, y|x_3) & = F_{Y^{x_2}|X}(y|x_3) - F_{Y^{x_1}|X}(y|x_3). 
\end{align}
$$
