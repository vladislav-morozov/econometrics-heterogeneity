## Setting 
 
In the simple RCT setting of the previous section, identification of QTE and DTEs is particularly simple. The required quantile and distribution functions can be directly read off from conditional quantile and distribution functions of the realized outcomes. 

However, in practice, it is more frequent and realistic to see a weaker (conditional) unconfoundedness assumption, which requires that the realized treatment $X_i$ and the collection of potential outcomes $\curl{Y_i^x}_x$ are independent only conditionally on some  covariates $W_i$:
$$
 \curl{Y_i^x}_x \independent X_i|W_i.
$$ {#eq-qte-unconf}
This setting is depicted on @fig-swig-obs. The setting of @eq-qte-unconf may correspond both to observational settings and experiments with stratification.

## Parameters of Interest

The setting of @eq-qte-unconf is richer than that of @eq-qte-rct. It allows us to consider all of the unconditional and conditional QTEs and DTEs described in section [-@sec-qte-intro].  

Specifically, in this section we focus on distributional treatment effects, while quantile treatment effects are discussed in the next section.
In order of identification, our parameteres of interest are


1.  DTE conditional on $W_i=w$ (@eq-qte-dfn-cond):
$$
\begin{align} 
DTE(x_1, x_2, y|w) & = F_{Y^{x_2}|W}(y|w) - F_{Y^{x_1}|W}(y|w).
\end{align}
$$
2. Unconditional  DTE (@eq-qte-dfn-uncond):
$$
\begin{aligned} 
DTE(x_1, x_2, y) & = F_{Y^{x_2}}(y) - F_{Y^{x_1}}(y). 
\end{aligned}
$$
3. DTE conditional on $X_i=x_3$ (@eq-qte-dfn-cond-treat):
$$
\begin{align} 
	DTE(x_1, x_2, y|x_3) & = F_{Y^{x_2}|X}(y|x_3) - F_{Y^{x_1}|X}(y|x_3). 
\end{align}
$$
