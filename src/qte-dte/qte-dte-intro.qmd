## Towards Cross-Sectional Data

The panel data results discussed in the previous sections

Unfortunately, the same success is generally hard to replicate in cross-sectional data. Typically need monotonicity assumptions [@Matzkin2003; @Matzkin2007]

This sections marks a shift: cross-sectional data and new parameters of interest --- quantile and distributional treatment effects.

## Defining QTEs and DTEs



### Potential Outcome Framwork 

To formalize the setting of this block and define the new parameters of interest, we go back to the cross-sectional potential outcome model of @eq-intro-potential-outcomes. 

Let $X_i$ be some treatment. $X_i$ may be scalar- or vector-valued. We are interested in the effect of $X_i$ on some outcome $Y_i$. 
To each value $x$ of $X_i$ we associate a potential outcome $Y^x_i$, determined as 
$$
Y_i^x = \phi(x, A_i).
$$
Like in the previous block,  $\phi$ is an unknown function and $A_i$ is some unobserved component, potentially infinite-dimensional. In this block, we will directly work with $Y_{i}^x$, rather than the $\phi(\cdot, A_i)$ representation. As before, at all points in time we assume that SUTVA holds (though see the comment box below regarding this point).

The key role in this section is played by the distribution of potential outcomes, where by "distribution" we mean either the cumulative distribution function $F_{Y^x}(\cdot)$ of $Y^x_i$ or its quantile function   $Q_{Y^x}(\cdot)$. 


### QTEs and DTEs
 


The new "distributional" parameters of interest are built up by contrasting the distributions of $Y^x$ for different values of $x$. The basic parameters of interest are  *quantile*  and *distributional  treatment effect* (QTE and DTE) of switching from $x_1$ to $x_2$, which
$$
\begin{aligned}
	QTE(x_1, x_2, \tau ) &  =Q_{Y^{x_2}}(\tau) - 	Q_{Y^{x_1}}(\tau) ,\\
		DTE(x_1, x_2, y) & = F_{Y^{x_2}}(y) - F_{Y^{x_1}}(y). 
\end{aligned}
$$
where $x_1, x_2$ are some values of the treatment and $\tau\in [0, 1]$. 

If the treatment is continuous, we  may further consider derivatives of $Q_{Y^x}(\tau)$ and $F_{Y^x}(y)$ with respect to $x$, yielding marginal QTEs and DTEs. 

We may also condition on the realized treatment values $X_i$ or on other control variables. For the first scenario,  let $F_{Y^{x_2}|X}(y|x_1)$ be the CDF of $Y^{x_2}$ conditional on $X=x_1$, similarly for the quantile function $Q_{Y^{x_2}|X}(\tau|x_1)$. The QTEs and DTEs  of switching from $x_1$ to $x_2$ for the population of units with realized treatment value $x_3$ are defined as 
$$
\begin{align}
	QTE(x_1, x_2, \tau|x_3) &  =Q_{Y^{x_2}|X}(\tau|x_3) - 	Q_{Y^{x_1}|X}(\tau|x_3) ,\\
	DTE(x_1, x_2, y|x_3) & = F_{Y^{x_2}|X}(y|x_3) - F_{Y^{x_1}|X}(y|x_3). 
\end{align}
$$
If $X_i$ is a scalar binary treatment, the quantile effects are also known as the   quantile treatment effects  for the treated or the control group, depending on whether $x_3=1$ or $x_3=0$ (QTT and QTC, respectively).
	
For the second scenario, let $W_i$ be some other covariates or control variables. One may consider the QTEs and DTEs within the $w$-stratum of $W_i$:
$$
\begin{align}
	QTE(x_1, x_2, \tau|w) & = Q_{Y^{x_2}|W}(\tau|w) - Q_{Y^{x_1}|W}(\tau|w), \\
		DTE(x_1, x_2, y|w) & = F_{Y^{x_2}|W}(y|w) - F_{Y^{x_1}|W}(y|w).
\end{align}
$$
 
The above QTEs and DTEs may be viewed as the core parameters of interest in the literature on the topic. However, one may also consider Gini-like and other transformations of the marginal distributions of potential outcomes, see section 2.1 in @Chernozhukov2013b for some further details.
 

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon=false}

There is an important difference between ATEs and QTEs when dealing with conditional and unconditional effects. When working with average effects, one may integrate the conditional average treatment effects given $W_i$ to obtain the ATE. This connection no longer holds for QTEs, and so the choice between conditional and unconditional QTEs is more important and leads to different interpretations. 

To understand the difference between conditional and unconditional, consider the following example.  Let $X_i$ be an indicator of participating in job training program, $W_i$ be the person's education level, and $Y_i$ be earnings. The 10th percentile of the potential outcomes for college-educated people may lie fairly high in the overall (marginal) distribution of outcomes. See @Powell2020 for more discussion and further references.

### Interpretations

#### Geometric Interpetation {.unnumbered}

Geometrically, DTEs and QTEs  effects can be viewed as measures of  the distance in the distributions of potential outcomes. The DTE measures the vertical difference between the CDFs, whereas the QTE measures the horizontal distance instead.   The figure offers a visual representation.

#### Causal Interpretation {.unnumbered}

Are the DTEs and QTEs of any policy interest?  A typical interpretation under SUTVA goes as follows.   QTEs and DTEs express the distributional effects of making one of the treatment options universal. Under SUTVA, the resulting distribution of outcomes will be exactly given by the marginal distribution of the corresponding potential outcomes. The QTEs and the DTEs will contrast the distributions under these two alternative options. 

Between the QTE and the DTE, the QTE is slightly easier to interpret, as QTEs are are expressed in terms of the outcome variable. In contrast, the DTEs are slightly more complicated to interpret, as they are expressed in terms of changes in CDFs.



#### Conditional or Unconditional Effects? {.unnumbered}



## QTEs vs Quantiles of Treatment Effects

Including "treatment effects" is possibly somewhat misleading




#### Next Section {.unnumbered}

In the next section, we discuss identification of QTEs and DTEs in a simple randomized control trial setting with (unconditional) unconfoundedness.
