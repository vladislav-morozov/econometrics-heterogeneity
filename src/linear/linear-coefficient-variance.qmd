## Beyond Average Coefficients

So far we have extensively discussed the average coefficient vector $\E[\bbeta_i]$ in our model ([-@eq-random_intercept]):
$$
y_{it} = \bx_{it}'\bbeta_i + u_{it}
$$
@sec-linear-mean-group has shown that the mean group estimator can consistently estimate $\E[\bbeta_i]$ even if we impose no restrictions on the dependence between $\bbeta_i$ and $\bx_{it}$.


However, average effects only offer a partial summary of the effects of $\bx_{it}$ (@Heckman1997). There are further parameters of interest, such as: 

- The moments of $\bbeta$:
  - The variance shows how much dispersion is there in the impact of covariates.
  - The skewness is informative about possible asymmetries in the effects.
  - Higher-order moments.
- The full distribution and quantiles of $\bbeta_i$. For example, the distribution may be used to compute  what proportion people benefit vs. how many people are hurt by $x_{it}$  with the knowledge of the distribution.
	

As it turns out, it is possible to identify such distributional features in a fixed effects framework in the static version of model [@Arellano2012]. In this section we discuss a streamlined version of their results for variance, while   @sec-linear-distribution shows how to identify the maximal object of interest â€” the full distribution.
