## Linearity and Heterogeneity

### Models with Homogeneous Slopes

We begin our journey where standard textbooks and first-year foundational courses in econometrics leave off. The "standard" linear models considered in such courses often assume homogeneity in individual responses to covariates (e.g., @Hansen2022). A common cross-sectional specification is:

$$
y_i = \bbeta'\bx_i + u_{i},
$$ {#eq-standard_linear}
where $i=1, \dots, N$ indexes cross-sectional units. 

In panel data, models often include unit-specific $(i)$ and time-specific $(t)$ intercepts while maintaining a common slope vector $\bbeta$:

$$
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \delta_t +  \bbeta'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.
$$ {#eq-panel_linear} 

### Heterogeneity in Slopes. Examples

However, modern economic theory rarely supports the assumption of homogeneous slopes $\bbeta$. Theoretical models recognize that observationally identical individuals, firms, and countries can respond differently to the same stimulus. In a linear model, this requires us to consider more flexible models with heterogeneous coefficients: 


1. Cross-sectional model ([-@eq-standard_linear]) generalizes to 

   $$
y_i = \bbeta_{i}'\bx + u_i.
   $$ {#eq-cross_sectional_hetero}

1. Panel data model ([-@eq-panel_linear]) generalizes to 

   $$
y_{it}  = \bbeta_{it}'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.
   $$ {#eq-panel_hetero}
 
Such models are worth studying, as they naturally arise in a variety of contexts:


- **Structural models with parametric restrictions:** Certain parametric restrictions yield linear relationships in coefficients.  An example is given by firm-level Cobb-Douglas production functions where firm-specific productivity differences induce heterogeneous coefficients (@Combes2012b; @Sury2011).

- **Binary covariates and interaction terms**: if all covariates are binary and all interactions are included, a linear model encodes all treatment effects without loss of generality (see, e.g., @Wooldridge2005).   

- **Log-linearized models:** Nonlinear models may be approximated by linear models around a steady-state. For example,  @Heckman1998 demonstrate how the nonlinear @Card2001 education model simplifies to a heterogeneous linear specification after linearization.

## What Do We Care About? Identification

### Parameters of Interest

The parameters of interest in models ([-@eq-standard_linear]) and ([-@eq-panel_linear]) are straightforward. The common slope $\bbeta$ simultaneously plays the role of both the average treatment effect and all the individual treatment effects. Estimating $\bbeta$ is enough for policy analysis.

The situation is more complicated for the more general models ([-@eq-cross_sectional_hetero]) and ([-@eq-panel_hetero]). Consider model ([-@eq-cross_sectional_hetero]). Parameters of interest now include:

- Individual effects: the coefficient vector $\bbeta_i$ for specific units.
- Moments of the distribution: the average coefficient vector ($\E[\bbeta_i]$), variance $\var(\bbeta_i)$, and higher-order moments.
- Distributional properties: The full distribution of $\bbeta_i$ or its quantiles, or just the tail behavior of the distribution.

Similar objects are relevant for the panel model in
@eq-panel_hetero.

### Regarding Identification

Unfortunately, greater flexibility in terms of parameters also leads to greater challenges in terms of identification. Models ([-@eq-cross_sectional_hetero]) and
([-@eq-panel_hetero]) are too general to permit identification of any of the above parameters without further assumptions. This failure of identification is driven by the combination of the following two issues:

1. Limited observations per coefficient vector. Since each unit $i$ (or pair $(i,t)$) provides only indirect information through $\bbeta_i'\bx_i$ (or $\bbeta_{it}'\bx_{it}$), there is effectively less than one observation per $\bbeta_i$.
2. Unrestricted dependence between coefficients and covariates. Without assumptions on the relationship between $\bbeta_i$ and $\bx_i$, identification is difficult.
 
Identification is typically achieved by mitigating one of these challenges. Common strategies to address these challenges include:

- Increasing the effective number of observations per coefficient vector by restricting coefficient variation. 
  - In panel settings, assuming time-invariant coefficients simplifies
    @eq-panel_hetero to:
    
    $$
y_{it} = \bbeta_i'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.
    $$ {#eq-time_invariant}
    
  - Alternative approaches assume a finite number of latent groups, each with its own coefficient vector, yielding the grouped structure:
    
    $$
y_{it} = \bbeta_{g_i, t}'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.
    $$ {#eq-grouped_model}
    
    This model in discussed in @Bonhomme2015, @Bester2016 (see also @Bonhomme2022DiscretizingUnobservedHeterogeneity).

- Restricting dependence between $\bbeta_i$ and $\bx_i$. For example, there is a strand of literature that assumes that $\bbeta_i$ and $\bx_i$ are independent [@Beran1996; @Hoderlein2010].
 
## Model of This Block

This block primarily focuses on the first strategy. Specifically, we will consider a version of model ([-@eq-panel_hetero]) with *time-invariant* heterogeneous coefficients:

$$
y_{it} = \bbeta_i'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.
$$ {#eq-lecture_model}

We do not impose restrictions on the dependence between $\bbeta_i$ and $\bx_{it}$. In general, it is important to allow for such dependence outside of experimental data —  economic agents can select their covariates $\bx_{it}$ based on knowledge of their own $\bbeta_i$. Since parametrizing this dependence is non-trivial, we impose no assumptions on it.

We will also generally focus on the case where the number $N$ of units is large, while the number $T$ of observations per unit is fixed and not necessarily large.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}

In the panel data literature, approaches that do not restrict the dependence between the unobserved and the observed components are called "fixed effects". 
::: 

 

Note that model ([-@eq-lecture_model]) includes a particular special case — the random intercept model (confusingly also called the "fixed effects model"). The random intercept model imposes homogeneity on all parameters except the intercept term. In the one-way case, the model takes the form: 

$$
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \bbeta'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.
$$ {#eq-random_intercept}
Model ([-@eq-random_intercept]) is one of the oldest ways of including unobserved heterogeneity in linear models and goes back at least to @Mundlak1961EmpiricalProductionFunction.
 
## Plan for This Block

In this block, we will focus on model ([-@eq-lecture_model]) and consider identification of the above parameters of interest. Specifically, 

1. **Average coefficient vector $\E[\bbeta_i]$**:
   - First, we demonstrate that standard estimators for the random intercept model ([-@eq-random_intercept]) are generally inconsistent for $\E[\bbeta_i]$ in the more general model ([-@eq-lecture_model]). 
   - Next, we introduce a mean group estimator robust to heterogeneity and dynamics.
  
2. **Variance $\var(\bbeta_i)$**: we show how one can identify and estimate $\var(\bbeta_i)$ by imposing structure on the temporal dependence in the residuals $u_{it}$.

3. **Identifying the Full Distribution of $\bbeta_i$:** we show how one can obtain the distribution of $\bbeta_i$ with a deconvolution argument.
 

Knowing these features of the distribution of $\bbeta_i$ allows one to compute the corresponding features of the treatment effects of changing from some treatment value $\bx_1$ to $\bx_2$ — these treatment effects are given by $\bbeta_1(\bx_2-\bx_1)$.

#### Next Section {.unnumbered}

Next, we show that the within (fixed effects) estimator recovers $\E[\bbeta_i]$ only under restrictive assumptions.
