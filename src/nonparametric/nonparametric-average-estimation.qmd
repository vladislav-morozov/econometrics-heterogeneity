## A More Explicit Identification Result

In the previous section, we have identified the average marginal effect for stayers in model ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]) in terms of a limit of average change in outcomes across periods (@eq-nonparametric-avg-me-identification-result):
$$
\begin{aligned}
 & \E\left[ \partial_x\phi(x, a, u)|X_{i1}=X_{i2}=x \right] \\
 & = \lim_{h\to 0} \left[ \dfrac{Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}}{h}\Bigg|X_{i1}=x, X_{i2} = x+h \right].
\end{aligned}
$$
This representation is convenient for identification and explicitly shows that the source of identification is the within variation of near-stayers.

At the same time, @eq-nonparametric-avg-me-identification-result is not quite convenient for estimation purposes. A direct application would require one to deal with limits. 

In order to circumvent this issue, we now focus on providing a more estimation-friendly version of @eq-nonparametric-avg-me-identification-result. To do so, define the function
$$
	g(x_1, x_2) = \E\left[Y_{i2}- Y_{i1}|X_{i1}=x_1, X_{i2} = x_2 \right] .
$$
Observe that $g(x, x) = 0$, and so by the definition of partial derivatives it holds that
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \E\left[\dfrac{Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}}{h}\Bigg|X_{i1}=x, X_{i2}= x+h \right] \\
& = \dfrac{g(x, x+h)}{h} = \dfrac{g(x, x+h) - g(x, x)}{h} \\
& \to \partial_{x_2} g(x, x),
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-avg-est-g}
where $\partial_{x_2}$ means the partial derivative with respect to the second argument. 

By combining @eq-nonparametric-avg-est-g with @eq-nonparametric-avg-me-identification-result, we obtain the following representation for the average marginal effects of stayers: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
	& \E[\partial_x\phi (x, A_i, U_{it})|X_{i1}=X_{i2}=x] \\
    & = \partial_{x_2} \E\left[Y_{i2}- Y_{i1}|X_{i1}=x_1, X_{i2} = x_2 \right]\Big|_{(x_1, x_2)=(x, x)}.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-avg-est-me}

The practical importance of @eq-nonparametric-avg-est-me is that it reduces the problem of estimating average marginal effects to the problem of estimating a derivative of a conditional function — a standard nonparametric regression problem.

#### Next Section {.unnumbered}

In the next section, we relax the stationarity assumption on the model to allow the structural function to change somewhat over time.
