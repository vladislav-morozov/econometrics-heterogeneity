## Index Restrictions

### Regarding Stayers

All the results of sections [-@sec-nonparametric-avg-id]-[-@sec-nonparametric-loc-scale] for the average marginal effect in models ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]) and ([-@eq-nonparametric-loc-scale-model]) are limited to the subpopulation of stayers (units $X_{i1}=X_{i2}$).

This limited scope is a natural consequence of *not restricting* the relationship between $(X_{i1}, X_{i2})$ and the unobserved components $(A_i, U_{it})$ which control the potential outcomes. In particular, the results of @Cooprider2022 suggest there is no identification for populations other than the population of stayers as long as one allows $(A_i, U_{it})$ to be multidimensional. 
 
### Index Restrictions

However, in some contexts some restrictions may be justified. Such restrictions, if present, may then be used to obtain identification for subpopulations other than the stayers. 

In this section, we look at a popular class of restrictions known as *index restrictions*. Broadly, index restrictions reduce the dimensionality of the dependence structure between the treatments and the unobserved components. They were introduced and studied by @Altonji2005 (see also @Bester2009 and @Liu2021).
 
As a simple example, consider again model ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]), with the potential outcome in period $t$ determined as 
$$
Y_{it}^x = \phi(x, A_i, U_{it}), \quad t=1, 2.
$$

We now make an assumption about how $(X_{i1}, X_{i2})$ and $(A_i, U_{i1}, U_{i2})$ relate to each other. Specifically, we assume that the joint distribution of $(A_i, U_{i1}, U_{i2})$ only depends on $(X_{i1}, X_{i2})$ through the sum $X_{i1}+X_{i2}$:
$$
\begin{aligned} 
	& f_{A_i, U_{i1}, U_{i2}|X_{i1}, X_{i2}}(a, u_1, u_2|x_1, x_2) \\
    & = f_{A_i, U_{i1}, U_{i2}|X_{i1}+ X_{i2}}(a, u_1, u_2|x_1+x_2).		
\end{aligned}
$$
In other words, the $X_{i1}+X_{i2}$ plays the role of an *index* or a sufficient statistic that captures all the relevant dimensions of the dependence structure between the treatments and the unobserved components.

More generally, in a setting with $T$ time periods one may assume that the joint distribution of potential outcomes $(Y_{i1}^{x_1}, \dots, Y_{iT}^{x_T})$ only depends on the treatments $(X_{i1}, \dots, X_{iT})$ through $k$ *index* functions $g_1(\cdot), \dots, g_k(\cdot)$:

$$\begin{aligned} 
	 & (Y_{i1}^{x_1}, \dots, Y_{iT}^{x_T})|X_{i1}, \dots, X_{iT} \\
     & \overset{d}{=} (Y_{i1}^{x_1}, \dots, Y_{iT}^{x_T})|g_1(X_{i1}, \dots, X_{iT}), \dots, g_k(X_{i1}, \dots, X_{iT}).
\end{aligned}
$$
$k$ is assumed to be smaller than $T$, creating a lower-dimensional dependence structure.

Typically, the index functions $g_{\cdot}(\cdot)$ are assumed known, though it is also posssible to obtain some results in settings with unknown $g(\cdot)$ [@Bester2009].

### Intuition

\paragraph{Empirical example: consumption}

To get some intuition for the above restriction, let us return to the Engel curve example.

Suppose that the agents are not financially constrained and have knowledge of both $(x_{i1}, x_{i2})$ in both $t=1, 2$. 

It is reasonable to assume that the agents will smooth consumption and income. 

Conditional on the average income across periods, the deviations in $(x_{i1}, x_{i2})$ are then assumed to be independent from the unobserved components of the model.

		, and that total consumption each period will only depend on total income $x_{i1}+x_{i2}$.
 






		This is a form of sufficiency assumption: $\bar{X}$ is a sufficient statistic.


## Average Marginal Effects Beyond Stayers

A consequence of this assumption is that 
\begin{equation}\label{nonparametric:equation:marginal_effects_hw12_sufficiency}
	\E[\partial_x \phi(x, \alpha_i, u_{it})|x_{i1}= x_1, x_{i2}=x_2] =\E\left[\partial_x \phi(x, \alpha_i, u_{it})\Big|\dfrac{x_{i1}+x_{i2}}{2}=\dfrac{x_1+x_2}{2}\right].
\end{equation}
In other words, the average marginal effect is the same for all people whose covariates  are the same \emph{on average across time}.

In some cases the index function 

This assumption allows us to identify and estimate average marginal effects for populations beyond the stayers.

The argument is based on the following special case of eq. \eqref{nonparametric:equation:marginal_effects_hw12_sufficiency}:
\begin{equation} 
	\E[\partial_x \phi(x, \alpha_i, u_{it})|x_{i1}=x_{i2}=x] =\E\left[\partial_x \phi(x, \alpha_i, u_{it})\Big|\dfrac{x_{i1}+x_{i2}}{2}=x\right] 
\end{equation}
Provided there are stayers at $x$, the argument of section \ref{nonparametric:subsection:hoderlein_white_identification} identifies the left hand side.


We conclude that $\E[\partial_x \phi( (x_1+x_2)/2, \alpha_i, u_{it})|x_{i1}=x_1, x_{i2}=x_2]$ is identified for all values of $(x_1, x_2)$ such that there are stayers at $(x_1+x_2)/2$. 
		, provided there are stayers at $(x_1+x_2)/2$. 
\textcolor{DarkGoldenrod}{Add a diagram of the identified set}

Estimation proceeds as before: the average marginal effect is estimated for a suitable population of stayers at $x$

The resulting value directly yields an estimator for the other unit with the same average value of $(x_{i1}, x_{i2})$.

\paragraph{Further references}

The above argument was one  example of a correlated random effects setting in which the distribution of unobservables depends only on some reduced ``index'' of observables.

In our case this index is one-dimensional and equal to the average covariate value.

However, in principle, more general indices are possible (average, variance, higher-order power, etc).
