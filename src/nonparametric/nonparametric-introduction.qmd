## Towards Nonparametric Models

### Motivation

We began these notes by analyzing the linear model ([-@eq-lecture_model]) with heterogeneous coefficients in depth. Such linear models are common in practice and naturally arise in a variety of contexts, as section [-@sec-linear-intro] points out. 
 

However, linearity becomes a restrictive assumption when working with non-binary covariates [@Wooldridge2005]. It often proves incompatible with underlying economic theories or the data itself. Consider cases like:

- Satiation of preferences in consumption and work supply
- Non-constant returns to scale in production
- Bounded dependent variables

These scenarios are likely incompatible with linearity. 

### Nonparametric Models


Nonparametric approaches offer a maximal solution to the issue of functional form.  In these settings, we simply assume that the outcome $y$ is determined by observed and unobserved variables through some unknown function $\phi$. Formally, we can write down generic nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity as follows: 


- In cross-sectional settings:
$$
	y_i = \phi(\bx_i, \alpha_i), \quad {}_{i=1,\dots, N},
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-generic-cross-section}
where $\bx_i$ includes the observed variables and $\alpha_i$ includes the unobserved components.

- In panel data settings
$$
	y_{it} = \phi(\bx_{it}, \alpha_i, u_{it}), \quad {}_{i=1,\dots, N}^{t= 1, \dots, T},
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-generic-panel}
where both $\alpha_i$ and $u_{it}$ are not observed. 

Models ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-cross-section]) and ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel]) parallel and generalize models ([-@eq-cross_sectional_hetero]) and ([-@eq-panel_hetero]).

In both cases the nature of $(\alpha_i, u_{it})$ is not restricted a priori. These unobserved components may include both finite-dimensional vectors (such as unobserved variables or coefficients) and infinite-dimensional objects (such as utility functions). In such a fully unrestricted setting, we can equivalently represent ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-cross-section]) and ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel]) as
$$
	y_i = \phi_i(x_i), \quad \quad  y_{it} = \phi_{it}(x_{it}),
$$
respectively. 


### Object of Interest


As in the linear case, possible objects of interest include:

-  The full structural function $\phi(\cdot, \cdot)$ or $\phi(\cdot, \cdot, \cdot)$. 	This function fully describes the relationship between $y$ and $\bx$ for all individuals. 	In this sense, one may view this goal as the problem of identifying individual treatment effects.
- Some distributional features of ``treatment effects''. In the context of model ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel]), these effects are given by
$$
	\begin{aligned}
		&	\phi(\bx_2, \alpha_i, u_{it}) - \phi(\bx_1, \alpha_i, u_{it}),\\
		&	\partial_{\bx} \phi(\bx_0, \alpha_i, u_{it}),
	\end{aligned}
$$    {#eq-nonparametric-effects}
where $\bx_0, \bx_1, \bx_2$ are some possible values for $\bx_{it}$, and the marginal effect is considered if $\phi$ is suitably differentiable in $\bx$.  	The distributional feature of interest may include average effects,   variances, higher-order moments, or the full distribution.

### Common Issue

Unfortunately, models ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-cross-section]) and ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel]) require further assumptions to be useful, as discussed in section [-@sec-introduction]. Without assumptions, we cannot hope to identify counterfactual objects of interest, not even average effects. 
 
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}

In a strict sense, one may point out that   ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-cross-section]) and ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel]) are not even models: they are just statements that $\bx$ and $y$ are related through some function that may differ with $i$ and $t$. Such a statement is vacuously true. For example, without further assumptions one may take $\phi(x, a) = a$ and $\alpha_i =y_i$ in  ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-cross-section]). 

:::

Typically, such assumptions fall into two categories:

1. Assumptions on the joint distribution of the observed and the unobserved components, including on the nature of $(\alpha_i, u_{it})$. 
2. Assumptions on how unobserved components enter the equation.

## Models of This Block
 
In these notes, we will focus on two instances of model ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel])  that are both general and straightforward to analyze. In both cases, we will consider models with continuous outcomes and assume that $T=2$. 

 
### First Model {.unnumbered}

We will begin with the following model:
$$
	y_{it} = \phi(x_{it}, \alpha_i, u_{it}), \quad {}_{i=1, \dots, N}^{t=1, 2}.
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep}
where for simplicity we assume that $x_{it}$ is scalar. The variable $x_{it}$ is assumed to be continuously distributed, and $\phi$  is continuous in $x_{it}$ for all values of $(\alpha_i, u_{it})$.

We  consider a version  of ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]) that is very general in terms of unobserved variables $(\alpha_{i}, u_{it})$. There are no restrictions on 

- The dimension and the form   of $\alpha_i$ and $u_{it}$;
- How the outcome depends on $(\alpha_{it}, u_{it})$;
- The dependence structure between $(\alpha_i, u_{it})$ and $x_{it}$.

At the same time, we will impose an assumption of stationarity on $u_{it}$. This assumption will mean the relationship in ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]) is stable over time in a suitable general sense. 


### Second Model {.unnumbered}

After reaching the (probable) limits of identification with ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]),  we will consider a different flavor of model ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel]), where the time-varying unobserved component $u_{it}$ is scalar and affects the outcome $y_{it}$ additively:
$$
y_{it} = \phi(x_{it}, \alpha_i) + u_{it}, \quad {}_{i=1, \dots, N}^{t=1, 2}
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-model-u-sep}
In contrast to model ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]), we will not assume that $u_{it}$ is stationary. Models  ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]) and ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-u-sep]) are hence non-nested. We will still allow $\alpha_i$ to be on unrestricted dimension and form. It may also have a complex dependence structure with $x_{it}$.


## Plan for This Block

In this block, we will focus on models ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep])-([-@eq-nonparametric-model-u-sep]) and consider identification of some distributional features of treatment effects ([-@eq-nonparametric-effects]). Specifically,

1. **Average** treatment and marginal **effects** for model ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]):
   - Show that identifying average effects is more complicated than just considering averages of the outcome.
   - Discuss heterogeneity bias, another form of confounding.
   - Show how stationarity assumptions on $u_{it}$ allow us to identify the average effects for a population of stayers — units with $x_{i1}=x_{i2}$ — without any further assumptions.
   - Consider two generalizations of the identification result: beyond the population of stayers and allowing some non-stationarity in the structural function.
2. **Variance** of treatment and marginal effects in model ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-u-sep]): identify the variance of effects  ([-@eq-nonparametric-effects]) by requiring that $u_{it}$ cannot depend on future values of $\bx_{it}$

 
In the next block, we will also revisit model ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep]) through the lens of quantile regression.

## A Brief Classification of Nonparametric Models

In these notes we primarily focus on the general and powerful models ([-@eq-nonparametric-model-full-nonsep])-([-@eq-nonparametric-model-u-sep]). However, much work has gone into analyzing other special instances of ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-cross-section]) and ([-@eq-nonparametric-generic-panel]). Before moving on to identification of average effects, we offer a brief taxonomy of nonparametric models with unobserved heterogeneity with some essential references. We characterize models based on the possible assumptions one may impose on them: 


- *How unobserved heterogeneity enters in the system*:
  - Full non-separable models  [@Altonji2005; @Hoderlein2007; @Hoderlein2007; @Chernozhukov2015].
  -  Partially additive separable panel models: [@Chen2003; @Evdokimov2012; @Blundell2012b; @Morozov2023jmp].
    - Fully separable, additively [@Henderson2008NonparametricEstimationTesting; @Boneva2015SemiparametricModelHeterogeneous; @Lee2015PanelNonparametricRegression;@Henderson2024NonparametricModelsFixed] or multiplicatively [@Beckert2008HeterogeneityNonParametricAnalysis].
- *What assumptions are imposed on the form of unobserved components*: restrictions on dimension such as scalarity [@Matzkin2003; @Altonji2005; @Imbens2009]  or no restrictions [@Hoderlein2007; @Hoderlein2007; @Chernozhukov2015]]
- *What assumptions are imposed on dependence structure between observed and unobserved components*: full or partial independence restrictions [@Hoderlein2007; @Imbens2009] vs. no independence restrictions [@Hoderlein2012; @Chernozhukov2015].
- *The nature of the outcome variable*: continuous-outcome models [@Chernozhukov2015] or discrete-outcome models [@Manski1987; @Chesher2017; @Chesher2020].
