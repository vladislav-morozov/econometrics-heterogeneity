## A Finite Difference Perspective on Heterogeneity Bias

The previous section highlighted how heterogeneity bias prevents identification of causal marginal effects using cross-sectional averages. We now show how panel data structure, together with smoothness and stationarity assumptions, can overcome this issue.

To motivate our identification strategy for average marginal effects, it is helpful to recall the definition of a derivative. Recall that the derivative of a function $g$ is just the limit of a sequence of finite differences:
$$
	g'(x) = \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\dfrac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}.
$$

If we take $g(x)=\E[Y_{it}|X_{it}=x]$, the above finite difference is given by 
$$
\begin{aligned}
	& \dfrac{\E[Y_{it}|X_{it} = x+h] - \E[Y_{it} |X_{it}=x] }{h} \\
    & =  \dfrac{\E[\phi(x+h, A_i, U_{it})|X_{it}=x+h] - \E[\phi(x,  A_i, U_{it})|X_{it}=x] }{h}.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-avg-FD-exp}
Notice that the conditioning sets on the two expectations are different. Consequently, the conditional distributions of $(A_i, U_{it})$ given $X_{it}$ are different between the two expectations. In other words, we cannot hold the distribution of  $(A_i, U_{it})$ fixed as we vary $x$ in $\E[Y_{it}|X_{it}]$. This violates the *ceteris paribus* logic required for interpreting $\partial_x \E[Y_{it} | X_{it} = x]$ as a causal effect, as mentioned in the previous section. 

The average marginal effect can itself be restated using a finite difference as
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \E[\partial_x\phi(x+h, A_i, U_{it}|\cdots] \\
&  = \E\left[\lim_{h\to 0}  \dfrac{ \phi(x+h, A_i, U_{it}) - \phi(x, A_i, U_{it})    }{h} \Bigg| \cdots \right].
\end{aligned}
$$  {#eq-nonparametric-avg-exp-fd-phi}
In this view, the failure of the naive approach of the previous section stems from the fact that we cannot interchange finite differences and expectations when using cross-sectional data in @eq-nonparametric-avg-FD-exp.




## Identifying Average Marginal Effects for Stayers



### Stationarity: Time as an Instrument

Panel data offers a natural way to address this failure of ceteris paribus reasoning. By comparing outcomes within the same unit, we can hold $A_i$ constant, isolating variation over time. 

At the same time, contrasting outcomes within the same unit necessarily means contrasting outcomes from different periods — and hence dealing with variation in $U_{it}$.

As it turns out, to handle such comparisons it is sufficient to assume that $U_{it}$ is conditionally stationary. Formally, we assume that the distribution $U_{i1}$ conditional on $(X_{i1}, X_{i2}, A_i)$ is equal to the conditional distribution of $U_{i2}$. Under this assumption, the distribution of $\phi(x, A_i, U_{it})$ does not depend on time $t$ any more given $(X_{i1}, X_{i2})$. Intuitively, one may think that time is randomly assigned to observations; an interpretation called "time as an instrument" [@Chernozhukov2013].

The stationarity assumption actually imposes a time-invariance assumption on the structural function $\phi$. To see why, note that under this assumption $U_{it}$ cannot contain changing deterministic variables, including time $t$. In general, if $t$ is part of $U_{it}$, then the function could change arbitrarily between periods. There is effectively no value in panel data if such arbitrary changes are possible. The stationarity assumption rules out such situations.

### Two Key Analysis Steps

We base our panel data identification argument on the following expectations involving $\phi$
$$
	\E\left[ \dfrac{\phi(x+h, A_i, U_{i2}) - \phi(x, A_i, U_{i1})}{h}\Bigg|\cdots \right].
$$ {#eq-nonparametric-avg-key-exp}
Expectation ([-@eq-nonparametric-avg-key-exp]) reflects the idea sketched out above:

- The same $A_i$ appears in both $\phi$ terms.
- The $U_{it}$ terms change over time.

The latter point means that ([-@eq-nonparametric-avg-key-exp]) does not involve a genuine finite difference in contrast to @eq-nonparametric-avg-exp-fd-phi. As a consequence, there are two key pieces in our analysis:

- *Continuity*: showing that expectation ([-@eq-nonparametric-avg-key-exp]) does converge to the average marginal effect as $h\to 0$, despite not involving the "correct" finite difference. 
- *Identification*: showing that the limit of expectation ([-@eq-nonparametric-avg-key-exp]) is identified as $h\to 0$. 

	 

### Identifying Moments of Finite Difference

We begin with the second piece, as it is straightforward to identify expectation ([-@eq-nonparametric-avg-key-exp])
