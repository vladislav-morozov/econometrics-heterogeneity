# Identifying Average Effects for Stayers {#sec-nonparametric-avg-id}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}

## Summary and Learning Outcomes

This section  

By the end of this section, you should

- Explain  

:::

## A First Difference Perspective on Heterogeneity Bias


## Identifying Average Marginal Effects for Stayers

### Stationarity: Time as an Instrument

### Two Key Analysis Steps

### Identifying Moments of Finite Difference

### Continuity of Average Finite Difference


### Combined Results


### Interpretation





## Are Stayers Interesting? 


## Lack of Identification for Other Populations 

basically as far as thins go without more assumptions 

Outside of stayers no identification for counterfactuals in this models, see counterexamples constructed by @Cooprider2022.
