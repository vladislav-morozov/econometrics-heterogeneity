Often the events have never yet been observed, and their probabilities must therefore be estimated by extrapolation of tail models fitted to available data. Because data concerning the event of interest may be very limited, efficient methods of inference play an important role. This article reviews this domain, emphasizing current research topics. We first sketch the classical theory of extremes for maxima and threshold exceedances of stationary series. We then review multivariate theory, distinguishing asymptotic independence and dependence models, followed by a description of models for spatial and spatiotemporal extreme events. Finally, we discuss inference and describe two applications. Animations illustrate some of the main ideas.},

  abstract = {The two-way linear fixed effects regression (2FE) has become a default method for estimating causal effects from panel data. Many applied researchers use the 2FE estimator to adjust for unobserved unit-specific and time-specific confounders at the same time. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that the ability of the 2FE model to simultaneously adjust for these two types of unobserved confounders critically relies upon the assumption of linear additive effects. Another common justification for the use of the 2FE estimator is based on its equivalence to the difference-in-differences estimator under the simplest setting with two groups and two time periods. We show that this equivalence does not hold under more general settings commonly encountered in applied research. Instead, we prove that the multi-period difference-in-differences estimator is equivalent to the weighted 2FE estimator with some observations having negative weights. These analytical results imply that in contrast to the popular belief, the 2FE estimator does not represent a designbased, nonparametric estimation strategy for causal inference. Instead, its validity fundamentally rests on the modeling assumptions.},

Identification is achieved without requiring computation of the conditional quantiles of the potential outcomes. Instead, the identification results for the marginal quantiles lead to an estimation procedure for the quantile treatment effect parameters that has two steps: nonparametric estimation of the propensity score and computation of the difference between the solutions of two separate minimization problems. Root-N consistency, asymptotic normality, and achievement of the semiparametric efficiency bound are shown for that estimator. A consistent estimation procedure for the variance is also presented. Finally, the method developed here is applied to evaluation of a job training program and to a Monte Carlo exercise. Results from the empirical application indicate that the method works relatively well even for a data set with limited overlap between treated and controls in the support of covariates. The Monte Carlo study shows that, for a relatively small sample size, the method produces estimates with good precision and low bias, especially for middle quantiles.},

Learning causality can be challenging, but it offers distinct advantages that elude a purely statistical mindset. Causal Inference and Discovery in Python helps you unlock the potential of causality. You'll start with basic motivations behind causal thinking and a comprehensive introduction to Pearlian causal concepts, such as structural causal models, interventions, counterfactuals, and more. Each concept is accompanied by a theoretical explanation and a set of practical exercises with Python code. Next, you'll dive into the world of causal effect estimation, consistently progressing towards modern machine learning methods. Step-by-step, you'll discover Python causal ecosystem and harness the power of cutting-edge algorithms. You'll further explore the mechanics of how "e;causes leave traces"e, and compare the main families of causal discovery algorithms. The final chapter gives you a broad outlook into the future of causal AI where we examine challenges and opportunities and provide you with a comprehensive list of resources to learn more.What you will learnMaster the fundamental concepts of causal inferenceDecipher the mysteries of structural causal modelsUnleash the power of the 4-step causal inference process in PythonExplore advanced uplift modeling techniquesUnlock the secrets of modern causal discovery using PythonUse causal inference for social impact and community benefitWho this book is forThis book is for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and machine learning researchers looking to extend their data science toolkit and explore causal machine learning. It will also help developers familiar with causality who have worked in another technology and want to switch to Python, and data scientists with a history of working with traditional causality who want to learn causal machine learning. It's also a must-read for tech-savvy entrepreneurs looking to build a competitive edge for their products and go beyond the limitations of traditional machine learning},

	abstract = {We propose a method to decompose the changes in the wage distribution over a period of time in several factors contributing to those changes. The method is based on the estimation of marginal wage distributions consistent with a conditional distribution estimated by quantile regression as well as with any hypothesized distribution for the covariates. Comparing the marginal distributions implied by different distributions for the covariates, one is then able to perform counterfactual exercises. The proposed methodology enables the identification of the sources of the increased wage inequality observed in most countries. Specifically, it decomposes the changes in the wage distribution over a period of time into several factors contributing to those changes, namely by discriminating between changes in the characteristics of the working population and changes in the returns to these characteristics. We apply this methodology to Portuguese data for the period 1986--1995, and find that the observed increase in educational levels contributed decisively towards greater wage inequality.

	abstract = {The ability of quantile regression models to characterize the heterogeneous impact of variables on different points of an outcome distribution makes them appealing in many economic applications. However, in observational studies, the variables of interest (e.g., education, prices) are often endogenous, making conventional quantile regression inconsistent and hence inappropriate for recovering the causal effects of these variables on the quantiles of economic outcomes. In order to address this problem, we develop a model of quantile treatment effects (QTE) in the presence of endogeneity and obtain conditions for identification of the QTE without functional form assumptions. The principal feature of the model is the imposition of conditions that restrict the evolution of ranks across treatment states. This feature allows us to overcome the endogeneity problem and recover the true QTE through the use of instrumental variables. The proposed model can also be equivalently viewed as a structural simultaneous equation model with nonadditive errors, where QTE can be interpreted as the structural quantile effects (SQE).},

In case of the well-known Hill estimator the optimal number knopt of largest order statistics was given by Hall and Welsh (1985) as a function of some parameters of the unknown distribution function F, which was assumed to admit a certain expansion. Moreover, an estimator of knopt was proposed that is consistent if a second-order parameter   of F belongs to a bounded interval. In contrast, we introduce a sequential procedure that yields a consistent estimator of knopt in the full model without requiring prior information about  . Then it is demonstrated that even in a more general setup the resulting adaptive Hill estimator is asymptotically as e cient as the Hill estimator based on the optimal number of order statistics. Finally, it is shown by Monte Carlo simulations that also for moderate sample sizes the procedure shows a reasonable performance, which can be improved further if   is restricted to bounded intervals. c{\copyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such settings are common in finance and other areas of economics. Our model allows for heterogeneous nonparametric covariate effects as well as unobserved time and individual specific effects that may depend on the covariates in an arbitrary way. To model the covariate effects parsimoniously, we impose a dimensionality reducing common component structure on them. In the theoretical part of the paper, we derive the asymptotic theory for the proposed procedure. In particular, we provide the convergence rates and the asymptotic distribution of our estimators. In the empirical part, we apply our methodology to a specific application that has been the subject of recent policy interest, that is, the effect of trading venue fragmentation on market quality. We use a unique dataset that reports the location and volume of trading on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies from 2008 to 2011 at the weekly frequency. We find that the effect of fragmentation on market quality is nonlinear and non-monotonic. The implied quality of the market under perfect competition is superior to that under monopoly provision, but the transition between the two is complicated.},

We show the “standard” bootstrap is consistent if and only if the second order derivative ϕ $\theta$ 0′′ =0 under regularity conditions, thereby identifying a source of bootstrap failures distinct from that in Fang and Santos (2018). Two consistent bootstrap schemes are proposed: one based on Babu (1984)that applies to differentiable maps and the other one based on Fang and Santos (2018)that applies to (second order)nondifferentiable maps. As an illustration, we develop a test of existence of (potentially multiple)common conditional heteroskedasticity features that improves upon Dovonon and Renault (2013).},

	abstract = {Semiparametric models to describe the functional relationship between k groups of observations are broadly applied in statistical analysis, ranging from nonparametric ANOVA to proportional hazard (ph) rate models in survival analysis. In this paper we deal with the empirical assessment of the validity of such a model, which will be denoted as a "structural relationship model". To this end Hadamard differentiability of a suitable goodness-of-fit measure in the k-sample case is proved. This yields asymptotic limit laws which are applied to construct tests for various semiparametric models, including the Cox ph model. Two types of asymptotics are obtained, first when the hypothesis of the semiparametric model under investigation holds true, and second for the case when a fixed alternative is present. The latter result can be used to validate the presence of a semiparametric model instead of simply checking the null hypothesis "the model holds true". Finally, various bootstrap approximations are numerically investigated and a data example is analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this review, we present econometric and statistical methods for analyzing randomized experiments. For basic experiments we stress randomization-based inference as opposed to sampling-based inference. In randomization-based inference, uncertainty in estimates arises naturally from the random assignment of the treatments, rather than from hypothesized sampling from a large population. We show how this perspective relates to regression analyses for randomized experiments. We discuss the analyses of stratified, paired, and clustered randomized experiments, and we stress the general efficiency gains from stratification. We also discuss complications in randomized experiments such as non-compliance. In the presence of non-compliance we contrast intention-to-treat analyses with instrumental variables analyses allowing for general treatment effect heterogeneity. We consider in detail estimation and inference for heterogeneous treatment effects in settings with (possibly many) covariates. These methods allow researchers to explore heterogeneity by identifying subpopulations with different treatment effects while maintaining the ability to construct valid confidence intervals. We also discuss optimal assignment to treatment based on covariates in such settings. Finally, we discuss estimation and inference in experiments in settings with interactions between units, both in general network settings and in settings where the population is partitioned into groups with all interactions contained within these groups.},

We propose a jackknifed version of the classical weak identification-robust Anderson–Rubin (AR) test statistic. Large-sample inference based on the jackknifed AR is valid under heteroscedasticity and weak identification. The feasible version of this statistic uses a novel variance estimator. The test has uniformly correct size and good power properties. We also develop a pre-test for weak identification that is related to the size property of a Wald test based on the Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator. This new pre-test is valid under heteroscedasticity and with many instruments.},

Many instruments arise from the use of ‘technical' instruments and more recently from the empirical strategy of ‘judge design'. This paper surveys and summarises ideas from recent literature on estimation and statistical inferences with many instruments for a single endogenous regressor. We discuss how to assess the strength of the instruments and how to conduct weak identification robust inference under heteroscedasticity. We establish new results for a jack-knifed version of the Lagrange Multiplier test statistic. Furthermore, we extend the weak identification robust tests to settings with both many exogenous regressors and many instruments. We propose a test that properly partials out many exogenous regressors while preserving the re-centring property of the jack-knife. The proposed tests have correct size and good power properties.},

	abstract = {In Instrumental Variables (IV) estimation, the effect of an instrument on an endogenous variable may vary across the sample. In this case, IV produces a local average treatment effect (LATE), and if monotonicity does not hold, then no effect of interest is identified. In this paper, I calculate the weighted average of treatment effects that is identified under general first-stage effect heterogeneity, which is generally not the average treatment effect among those affected by the instrument. I then describe a simple set of data-driven approaches to modeling variation in the effect of the instrument. These approaches identify a Super-Local Average Treatment Effect (SLATE) that weights treatment effects by the corresponding instrument effect more heavily than LATE. Even when first-stage heterogeneity is poorly modeled, these approaches considerably reduce the impact of small-sample bias compared to standard IV and unbiased weak-instrument IV methods, and can also make results more robust to violations of monotonicity. In application to a published study with a strong instrument, the preferred approach reduces error by about 19{\%} in small (N ≈ 1, 000) subsamples, and by about 13{\%} in larger (N ≈ 33, 000) subsamples.},

	abstract = {When in proxy-SVARs the covariance matrix of VAR disturbances is subject to exogenous, permanent, nonrecurring breaks that generate target impulse response functions (IRFs) that change across volatility regimes, even strong, exogenous external instruments can result in inconsistent estimates of the dynamic causal effects of interest if the breaks are not properly accounted for. In such cases, it is essential to explicitly incorporate the shifts in unconditional volatility in order to point-identify the target structural shocks and possibly restore consistency. We demonstrate that, under a necessary and sufficient rank condition that leverages moments implied by changes in volatility, the target IRFs can be point-identified and consistently estimated. Importantly, standard asymptotic inference remains valid in this context despite (i) the covariance between the proxies and the instrumented structural shocks being local-to-zero, as in Staiger and Stock (1997), and (ii) the potential failure of instrument exogeneity. We introduce a novel identification strategy that appropriately combines external instruments with "informative" changes in volatility, thus obviating the need to assume proxy relevance and exogeneity in estimation. We illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested method by revisiting a fiscal proxy-SVAR previously estimated in the literature, complementing the fiscal instruments with information derived from the massive reduction in volatility observed in the transition from the Great Inflation to the Great Moderation regimes.},

Asymptotic representations are provided for various statistics, including two-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators, Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification and endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions are found to provide good approximations to sampling distributions with 10-20 observations per instrument. The theory suggests concrete guidelines for applied work, including using nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions. These results are used to interpret Angrist and Krueger's (1991) estimates of the returns to education: whereas TSLS estimates with many instruments approach the OLS estimate of 6{\%}, the more reliable LIML estimates with fewer instruments fall between 8{\%} and 10{\%}, with a typical 95{\%} confidence},

The averages are true ones, normalized by the corresponding sums of weights, which are only assumed to be non-negative. The L2-norm convergence in the mixing case is shown to rely upon very simple conditions on the weights. We show that 'quasimonotone weights' with a simple additional condition yield a.e. convergence of weighted averages for all Dunford-Schwartz contractions of probability spaces and L1-functions. For independent random variables, we look at weighted averages of centered random variables with bounded variances (or bounded moments of some order greater than 1), in particular the iid case, and obtain several sufficient conditions on the weights for almost sure convergence (weighted SLLN). For example, in Theorem 4.14 we show that if a weight sequence {\{}wk{\}} with divergent partial sums Wn satisfies supn≥1 1/W n ∑k=1n wk(log(w k+1))$\beta$ {\textless} ∞ for some $\beta$ {\textgreater} 1 then for any iid sequence in the class L(log+L)1+∈ the weighted averages converge almost surely to the expectation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

The relationship between demographic ageing and employment outcomes is even more worrying once the relationship is scrutinized at the regional level. We focus on modelling regional heterogeneity. We argue that an average impact across regions is often not very useful, and that—conditional on the region's characteristics—impacts may differ significantly. We advocate the use of modelling varying level and slope effects, and specifically to cluster them by the use of latent class or finite mixture models (FMMs). Moreover, in order to fully exploit the output from the FMM, we adopt self-organizing maps to understand the composition of the resulting segmentation and as a way to depict the underlying regional similarities that would otherwise be missed if a standard approach was adopted. We apply our proposed method to a case-study of Germany where we show that the regional impact of young age cohorts on the labor market is indeed very heterogeneous across regions and our results are robust against potential endogeneity bias.},

Nevertheless, only a few studies exist which have applied spatial models to forecast over small spatial units such as cities, districts or counties. The majority of predictions are developed with quarterly or yearly time series for a country or at regional level. The paper presents the above phenomena and deals with the problem of simultaneous forecasting of the unemployment rate over 35 poviats (districts and cities) in one of the Polish provinces. Two extremely different models with spatial dependencies were developed and estimated in this paper: the Spatial Vector Autoregressions (SpVAR) and the Spatial Artificial Neural Network (SpANN). The 13-month out-of-sample forecast is based on high frequency, raw, monthly panel data extracted from 31 local labor offices. The procedure worked out here allows comparing the forecasting performance of spatial models with their non-spatial and seasonal equivalents. The inclusion of a spatial component into the models significantly improves the accuracy of forecasts; however, the overall performance of SpVAR is 30{\%} better than SpANN.},

To illustrate, we utilize a state-level event-study focused on the costliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. mainland since 2004 in order to estimate the elasticity of initial unemployment insurance (UI) claims with respect to search intensity, as measured by Google Trends. We show that our hurricane-driven Google Trends elasticity leads to superior real-time forecasts of initial UI claims relative to other commonly used models. Our approach is also amenable to forecasting both at the state and national levels, and is shown to be well-calibrated in its assessment of the level of uncertainty for its out-of-sample predictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {The geographical distribution and persistence of regional/local unemployment rates in heterogeneous economies (such as Germany) have been, in recent years, the subject of various theoretical and empirical studies. Several researchers have shown an interest in analyzing the dynamic adjustment processes of unemployment and the average degree of dependence of the current unemployment rates or gross domestic product from the ones observed in the past. In this paper, we present a new econometric approach to the study of regional unemployment persistence, in order to account for spatial heterogeneity and/or spatial autocorrelation in both the levels and the dynamics of unemployment. First, we propose an econometric procedure suggesting the use of spatial filtering techniques as a substitute for fixed effects in a panel estimation framework. The spatial filter computed here is a proxy for spatially distributed region-specific information (e.g., the endowment of natural resources, or the size of the "home market") that is usually incorporated in the fixed effects coefficients. The advantages of our proposed procedure are that the spatial filter, by incorporating region-specific information that generates spatial autocorrelation, frees up degrees of freedom, simultaneously corrects for time-stable spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, and provides insights about the spatial patterns in regional adjustment processes. We present several experiments in order to investigate the spatial pattern of the heterogeneous autoregressive coefficients estimated for unemployment data for German NUTS-3 regions. We find widely heterogeneous but generally high persistence in regional unemployment rates. {\textcopyright} 2012, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We find a robust positive effect of increased air pollution on violent crimes, and specifically assaults, but no relationship between increases in air pollution and property crimes. The effects are present in and out of the home, at levels well below Ambient Air Pollution Standards, and PM2.5 effects are strongest at lower temperatures.

  abstract = {This article reviews recent significant progress made in developing estimation and inference methods for nonlinear models in the presence of mismeasured data that may or may not conform to the classical assumption of independent zero-mean errors. The aim is to cover a broad range of methods having differing levels of complexity and strength of the required assumptions. Simple approaches that form the elementary building blocks of more advanced approaches are discussed first. Then, special attention is devoted to methods that rely on readily available auxiliary variables (e.g., repeated measurements, indicators, or instrumental variables). Results relaxing most of the commonly invoked simplifying assumptions are presented (linear measurement structure, independent errors, zero-mean errors, availability of auxiliary information). This article also provides an overview of important connections with related fields, such as latent variable models, nonlinear panel data, factor models, and set identification, and applications of the methods to other fields traditionally unrelated to measurement error models.},

We study how the optimal regularization parameter changes when the optimality criteria changes, under a broad range of smoothness assumptions on the solution, the kernel of the integral operator, and the penalty functional. Although some of the calculations we present have been given elsewhere, we organize the results with a specific goal in mind. That is, we study a certain class of problems within which we can identify conditions on the solution, the kernel of the operator and the penalty functional for which the rate at which the optimal regularization parameter goes to zero is the same for both predictive mean square error and solution mean square error optimality criteria, and for which it is different. The former circumstances are of interest because then data based estimates of the regularization parameter such as generalized cross-validation, which are known to be optimal for predictive mean square error, will also go to zero at the optimal rate for solution mean square error. {\textcopyright} 1990, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

@article{Horowitz2011,
	abstract = {Instrumental variables are widely used in applied econometrics to achieve identification and carry out estimation and inference in models that contain endogenous explanatory variables. In most applications, the function of interest (e.g., an Engel curve or demand function) is assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters (e.g., a linear model), and instrumental variables are used to identify and estimate these parameters. However, linear and other finite-dimensional parametric models make strong assumptions about the population being modeled that are rarely if ever justified by economic theory or other a priori reasoning and can lead to seriously erroneous conclusions if they are incorrect. This paper explores what can be learned when the function of interest is identified through an instrumental variable but is not assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters. The paper explains the differences between parametric and nonparametric estimators that are important for applied research, describes an easily implemented nonparametric instrumental variables estimator, and presents empirical examples in which nonparametric methods lead to substantive conclusions that are quite different from those obtained using standard, parametric estimators. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Econometric Society.},

Apart from an asymptotically negligible remainder, the MGCp criterion has expected value equal to the sum of squared errors of a fitted derivative (rather than of a fitted mean response). Thus, unlike traditional criteria for tuning parameter selection, MGCp is not prone to undersmoothed derivative estimation. We illustrate a scientific application in a case study that explores the relationship among three measures of liver function. Since recent technological developments hold promise for assessing two of these measures outside of medical and laboratory facilities, better understanding of the aforementioned relationship may allow enhanced monitoring of liver function, especially in developing countries and among persons for whom access to medical and laboratory facilities is limited.},

@article{Palma2020,
	abstract = {The simulated choice probabilities in mixed logit models are usually approximated numerically using Halton or random draws from a multivariate mixing distribution for the random parameters. Theoretically, the order in which the estimated variables enter the model should not matter. However, in practice, simulation “noise” inherent in the numerical procedure leads to differences in the magnitude of the estimated coefficients depending on the arbitrary order in which the random variables are estimated. The problem is exacerbated when a low number of draws are used or if correlation among coefficients is allowed. In particular, the Cholesky factorization procedure, which is used to incorporate correlation into the model, propagates simulation noise in the estimate of one coefficient to estimates of all subsequent coefficients in the model. Ignoring the potential ordering effects in simulated maximum likelihood estimation methods may seriously compromise the ability of replicating the results and can inadvertently influence policy recommendations. We find that better estimation accuracy is achieved with Halton draws using small prime numbers as it is the case for small integrating dimensions; but random draws provide better accuracy than Halton draws from large prime numbers as it is normally the case in high integrating dimensions. With correlation, the standard deviations have very large fluctuations depending on the order of the variables, affecting the conclusions regarding heterogeneity of preferences.},

	abstract = {Maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) procedure is generally adopted in discrete choice analysis to solve complex models without closed mathematical formulation. This procedure differs from the maximum likelihood simply because simulated probabilities are inserted into the Log-Likelihood (LL) function. The LL function to be maximized is the sum of the logarithm of the expected choice probabilities; since the logarithmic operation is a nonlinear transformation bias is then introduced. The simulation bias depends on the number of draws that are used in the simulation and on the sample size. Although the asymptotic properties of the MSL estimator are well known, the question is how simulation bias affects parameters estimation and therefore the main outcomes of choice models (for instance value of travel time and market shares). In this paper, we estimate explicitly the simulation bias in mixed logit parameter estimation, using Taylor expansion and we correct the log-likelihood objective function during the maximization process. The method is developed in the context of Monte Carlo simulation. We report significant error reduction on the final objective value but also on the optimal parameters. The method could be extended to randomized quasi-Monte Carlo techniques as long as standard deviations of simulated choice probabilities are calculated. Computation costs can be neglected when using Monte Carlo draws and even when advanced strategies such as adaptive sampling methodology are in use.},

They have been the focus of a substantial quantity of research in the context of actuarial and financial risk assessment over the last decade. The behaviour and estimation of unconditional extreme expectiles using independent and identically distributed heavy-tailed observations have been investigated in a recent series of papers. We build here a general theory for the estimation of extreme conditional expectiles in heteroscedastic regression models with heavy-tailed noise; our approach is supported by general results of independent interest on residual-based extreme value estimators in heavy-tailed regression models, and is intended to cope with covariates having a large but fixed dimension. We demonstrate how our results can be applied to a wide class of important examples, among which are linear models, single-index models as well as ARMA and GARCH time series models. Our estimators are showcased on a numerical simulation study and on real sets of actuarial and financial data.},

	abstract = {Many empirical studies estimate impulse response functions that depend on the state of the economy. Most of these studies rely on a variant of the local projection (LP) approach to estimate the state-dependent impulse response functions. Despite its widespread application, the asymptotic validity of the LP approach to estimating state-dependent impulse responses has not been established to date. We formally derive this result for a structural state-dependent vector autoregressive process. The model only requires the structural shock of interest to be identi{\ldots}ed. A su¢ cient condition for the consistency of the state-dependent LP estimator of the response function is that the {\ldots}rst-and second-order conditional moments of the structural shocks are independent of current and future states, given the information available at the time the shock is realized. This rules out models in which the state of the economy is a function of current or future realizations of the outcome variable of interest, as is often the case in applied work. Even when the state is a function of past values of this variable only, consistency may hold only at short horizons.},

The identification condition relates to the bounded completeness and the estimation procedure applies the sieve minimum distance estimation of conditional moment restrictions, allowing for endogeneity. We establish a new root mean squared convergence rate for the nonparametric instrumental variable regression when the endogenous regressor could have unbounded support. Root-n asymptotic normality and semiparametric efficiency of the parametric components are also given under a set of "low-level" sufficient conditions.

Two sources of additional information concerning the unobservable regressor are considered: either an additional indicator of the regressor (itself measured with error) or instrumental variables which characterize the systematic variation in the true regressor. In both cases, estimators are constructed by relating moments involving the unobserved variables to moments of observables; these relations lead to recursion formulae for computation of the regression coefficients and nuisance parameters (e.g., moments of the measurement error). Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated coefficients is demonstrated, and consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariant matrices are provided. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

First, we find that the 'Lesser-Working' specification of budget shares regressed on the log of income or expenditure should be generalized to higher-order terms in log income. Also, we find that errors in variables in either reported income or expenditure should be accounted for.

We extend their ideas of using the debiased estimator and further propose a bootstrap approach for constructing simultaneous confidence bands. This modified method has an advantage that we can easily choose the smoothing bandwidth from conventional bandwidth selectors and the confidence band will be asymptotically valid. We prove the validity of the bootstrap confidence band and generalize it to density level sets and inverse regression problems. Simulation studies confirm the validity of the proposed confidence bands/sets. We apply our approach to an Astronomy dataset to show its applicability.},

	abstract = {Many studies use matched employer-employee data to estimate a statistical model of earnings determination where log-earnings are expressed as the sum of worker effects, firm effects, covariates, and idiosyncratic error terms. Estimates based on this model have produced two influential yet controversial conclusions. First, firm effects typically explain around 20{\%} of the variance of log-earnings, pointing to the importance of firm-specific wage-setting for earnings inequality. Second, the correlation between firm and worker effects is often small and sometimes negative, indicating little if any sorting of high-wage workers to high-paying firms. The objective of this paper is to assess the sensitivity of these conclusions to the biases that arise because of limited mobility of workers across firms. We use employer-employee data from the US and several European countries while taking advantage of both fixed-effects and random-effects methods for bias-correction. We find that limited mobility bias is severe and that bias-correction is important. Once one corrects for limited mobility bias, firm effects matter less for earnings inequality and worker sorting becomes always positive and typically strong.},

This paper undertakes a quantitative review of the empirical literature on agglomeration through a meta-analysis of 729 elasticities taken from 34 different studies. The objective is to make sense of the range of values for agglomeration economies found in the literature by identifying some key characteristics that affect the magnitude of the results obtained. Our analysis confirms that study characteristics do matter. In particular, we find that country specific effects, the industrial coverage, the specification of agglomeration economies, and the presence of controls for both unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity and differences in time-variant labor quality can give rise to large differences in the results reported in the literature. In contrast, correcting for reverse causality of agglomeration does not seem to produce noticeable changes in the size of urban agglomeration estimates. We also test for publication bias and find some evidence supporting the presence of positive reporting bias. The findings support the intuition that agglomeration estimates for any particular empirical context may have little relevance elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Asplund2006,
	abstract = {This paper is motivated by the empirical regularity that industries differ greatly in the level of firm turnover and that entry and exit rates are positively correlated across industries. Our objective is to investigate the effect of fixed costs and, in particular, market size on entry and exit rates and hence on the age distribution of firms. We analyse a stochastic dynamic model of a monopolistically competitive industry. Each firm's efficiency is assumed to follow a Markov process. We show existence and uniqueness of a stationary equilibrium with simultaneous entry and exit: efficient firms survive, while inefficient ones leave the market and are replaced by new entrants. We perform comparative dynamics with respect to the level of fixed costs: entry costs are negatively related and fixed production costs positively related to entry and exit rates. A central empirical prediction of the model is that the level of firm turnover is increasing in market size. In larger markets, competition is endogenously more intense than in smaller markets, and so price-cost margins are smaller. This price competition effect implies that the marginal surviving firm has to be more efficient than in smaller markets. Hence, in larger markets, the expected lifespan of firms is shorter, and the age distribution of firms is first-order stochastically dominated by that in smaller markets. In the empirical part, the prediction on market size and firm turnover is tested on an industry where firms compete in well-defined geographical markets of different sizes.

We first show that in the case where the location function is strictly less than the (fixed) censoring point for all values in the support of the explanatory variables, the location function is not identified anywhere. In contrast, when the location function is greater or equal to the censoring point with positive probability, the location function is identified on the entire support, including the region where the location function is below the censoring point. In the latter case we propose a simple estimation procedure based on combining conditional quantile estimators for various higher quantiles.

A small-scale simulation study indicates that the proposed estimation procedure performs well in finite samples.

We analyze the properties of the minimum MSE unit averaging estimator in a local heterogeneity framework inspired by the literature on frequentist model averaging. The analysis of the estimator covers both the cases in which the cross-sectional dimension of the panel is fixed and large. In both cases, we obtain the local asymptotic distribution of the minimum MSE unit averaging estimators and of the associated weights.

 @article{Wu2020,
 	abstract = {The method of moments (Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A 185 (1894) 71–110) is one of the most widely used methods in statistics for parameter estimation, by means of solving the system of equations that match the population and estimated moments. However, in practice and especially for the important case of mixture models, one frequently needs to contend with the difficulties of non-existence or nonuniqueness of statistically meaningful solutions, as well as the high computational cost of solving large polynomial systems. Moreover, theoretical analyses of the method of moments are mainly confined to asymptotic normality style of results established under strong assumptions. This paper considers estimating a k-component Gaussian location mixture with a common (possibly unknown) variance parameter. To overcome the aforementioned theoretic and algorithmic hurdles, a crucial step is to denoise the moment estimates by projecting to the truncated moment space (via semidefinite programming) before solving the method of moments equations. Not only does this regularization ensure existence and uniqueness of solutions, it also yields fast solvers by means of Gauss quadrature. Furthermore, by proving new moment comparison theorems in the Wasserstein distance via polynomial interpolation and majorization techniques, we establish the statistical guarantees and adaptive optimality of the proposed procedure, as well as oracle inequality in misspecified models. These results can also be viewed as provable algorithms for generalized method of moments (Econometrica 50 (1982) 1029–1054) which involves nonconvex optimization and lacks theoretical guarantees.},

Here the possibilities of using sample moments to identify mixtures of multivariate normals are investigated. A particular system of moment equations is devised and then shown to be one that identifies the true mixing distribution, with some limitations (indicated in the text), and thus provides consistent estimates. Moreover, the estimates are shown to be quickly calculated in any dimension and to be highly efficient in the sense of being close to the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. This is shown by simulation and the application of the method to Fisher's iris data.

	abstract = {This paper shows that large nonparametric classes of conditional multivariate densities can be approximated in the Kullback-Leibler distance by different specifications of finite mixtures of normal regressions in which normal means and variances and mixing probabilities can depend on variables in the conditioning set (covariates). These models are a special case of models known as "mixtures of experts" in statistics and computer science literature. Flexible specifications include models in which only mixing probabilities, modeled by multinomial logit, depend on the covariates and, in the univariate case, models in which only means of the mixed normals depend flexibly on the covariates. Modeling the variance of the mixed normals by flexible functions of the covariates can weaken restrictions on the class of the approximable densities. Obtained results can be generalized to mixtures of general location scale densities. Rates of convergence and easy to interpret bounds are also obtained for different model specifications. These approximation results can be useful for proving consistency of Bayesian and maximum likelihood density estimators based on these models. The results also have interesting implications for applied researchers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

We establish the uniform consistency over a compact set of logarithmically increasing dimension.

We first present an empirical analysis that motivates the theoretical analysis which follows. The theoretical analysis considers a simple two-state, first-order Markov chain model without covariates in which both transition probabilities are heterogeneous. Using such a model we are able to derive exact small sample results for bias and mean squared error (MSE). We discuss the maximum likelihood approach and derive two novel estimators. The first is a bias corrected version of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) although the second, which we term MIMSE, minimizes the integrated mean square error. The MIMSE estimator is always well defined, has a closed-form expression and inherits the desirable large sample properties of the MLE. Our main finding is that in almost all short panel contexts the MIMSE significantly outperforms the other two estimators in terms of MSE. A final section extends the MIMSE estimator to allow for exogenous covariates. {\textcopyright} The Author(s). Journal compilation {\textcopyright} Royal Economic Society 2010.},

@article{Browning2007,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION There is general agreement that there is a good deal of heterogeneity in observed behavior. Heckman in his Nobel lecture (Heckman, 2001) states: “the most important discovery [from the widespread use of micro-data is] the evidence on the pervasiveness of heterogeneity and diversity in economic life.” This is true but to see it in print as a “discovery” is a surprise since we have internalized it so thoroughly and it is now second nature for anyone working with microdata to consider heterogeneity. We have been unable to find a consensus definition of heterogeneity. A definition we suggest (which derives from Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro, 2005) is that heterogeneity is the dispersion in factors that are relevant and known to individual agents when making a particular decision. Latent heterogeneity would then be those relevant factors that are known to the agent but not to the researcher. The heterogeneity could be differences in tastes, beliefs, abilities, skills, or constraints. Note that this definition does not impose that heterogeneity is constant over time for a given individual nor that because something is fixed and varies across the population that it is necessarily heterogeneous. Examples of the former would be changing information sets and an example of the latter would be, say, some genetic factor which impacts on outcomes but which is unobserved by any agent. Thus a “fixed effect” in an econometric model may or may not be consistent with heterogeneity, as defined here. Our definition of heterogeneity distinguishes it clearly from uncertainty, measurement error, and model misspecification that are other candidates for the variation we see around the predictions of a given deterministic model.},

	abstract = {The problem of estimating the mean of a normal vector with known but unequal variances introduces substantial difficulties that impair the adequacy of traditional empirical Bayes estimators. By taking a different approach that treats the known variances as part of the random observations, we restore symmetry and thus the effectiveness of such methods. We suggest a group-linear empirical Bayes estimator, which collects observations with similar variances and applies a spherically symmetric estimator to each group separately. The proposed estimator is motivated by a new oracle rule which is stronger than the best linear rule, and thus provides a more ambitious benchmark than that considered in the previous literature. Our estimator asymptotically achieves the new oracle risk (under appropriate conditions) and at the same time is minimax. The group-linear estimator is particularly advantageous in situations where the true means and observed variances are empirically dependent. To demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods in real applications, we analyze the baseball data used by Brown (2008), where the group-linear methods achieved the prediction error of the best nonparametric estimates that have been applied to the dataset, and significantly lower error than other parametric and semiparametric empirical Bayes estimators.},

In small samples, however, extreme value theory might well provide good approximations for only a relatively small number of tail observations. To accommodate this concern, we develop asymptotically valid confidence intervals for high quantile and tail conditional expectations that only require extreme value theory to hold for the largest k observations, for a given and fixed k. Small-sample simulations show that these “fixed-k” intervals have excellent small-sample coverage properties, and we illustrate their use with mainland U.S. hurricane data. In addition, we provide an analytical result about the additional asymptotic robustness of the fixed-k approach compared to kn → ∞ inference.},

Our approach, which is an extension of the classical Stein-Tikhomirov method, rests on a new pair of linear operators acting on characteristic functions. In principle, this method is admissible for any approximating sequence and any target, although obviously the conjunction of several favorable factors is necessary in order for the resulting bounds to be of interest. As we briefly discuss, our approach is particularly promising whenever some version of Stein's method applies. We apply our approach to two examples. The first application concerns convergence in law towards targets {\$}F{\_}\backslashinfty{\$} which belong to the second Wiener chaos (i.e. {\$}F{\_}{\{}\backslashinfty{\}}{\$} is a linear combination of independent centered chi-squared rvs). We detail an application to {\$}U{\$}-statistics. The second application concerns convergence towards targets belonging to the generalized Dickman family of distributions. We detail an application to a theorem from number theory. In both cases our method produces bounds of the correct order (up to a logarithmic loss) in terms of quantities which occur naturally in Stein's method.},

	abstract = {It is often of interest to condition on a singular event given by a random variable, e.g. {\$}\backslash{\{}Y=y\backslash{\}}{\$} for a continuous random variable {\$}Y{\$}. Conditional measures with respect to this event are usually derived as a special case of the conditional expectation with respect to the random variables generating sigma algebra. The existence of the latter is usually proven via a non-constructive measure-theoretic argument which yields an only almost-everywhere defined quantity. In particular, the quantity {\$}\backslashmathbb E[f|Y]{\$} is initially only defined almost everywhere and conditioning on {\$}Y=y{\$} corresponds to evaluating {\$}\backslashmathbb E[f|Y=y] = \backslashmathbb E[f|Y]{\{}Y=y{\}}{\$}, which is not meaningful because of {\$}\backslashmathbb E[f|Y]{\$} not being well-defined on such singular sets. This problem is not addressed by the introduction of regular conditional distributions, either. On the other hand it can be shown that the naively computed conditional density {\$}f{\_}{\{}Z|Y=y{\}}(z){\$} (which is given by the ratio of joint and marginal densities) is a version of the conditional distribution, i.e. {\$}\backslashmathbb E[\backslash{\{}Z\backslashin B\backslash{\}}|Y=y] = \backslashint{\_}B f{\_}{\{}Z|Y=y{\}}(z) dz{\$} and this density can indeed be evaluated pointwise in {\$}y{\$}. This mismatch between mathematical theory (which generates an object which cannot produce what we need from it) and practical computation via the conditional density is an unfortunate fact. Furthermore, the classical approach does not allow a pointwise definition of conditional expectations of the form {\$}\backslashmathbb E[f|Y=y]{\$}, only of conditional distributions {\$}\backslashmathbb E[\backslash{\{}Z\backslashin B\backslash{\}}|Y=y]{\$}. We propose a (as far as the author is aware) little known approach to obtaining a pointwise defined version of conditional expectation by use of the Lebesgue-Besicovich lemma without the need of additional topological arguments which are necessary in the usual derivation.},

	abstract = {Meta-analyses are typically used to estimate the overall/mean of an outcome of interest. However, inference about between-study variability, which is typically modelled using a between-study variance parameter, is usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely used by default to estimate the between-study variance, has been long challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the between-study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16 estimators for the between-study variance, seven methods to calculate confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between-study variance. Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we recommend the Q-profile method and the alternative approach based on a 'generalised Cochran between-study variance statistic' to compute corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing literature and expert consensus. Evidence-based recommendations require an extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews a set of recent studies that have attempted to measure the causal effect of education on labor market earnings by using institutional features of the supply side of the education system as exogenous determinants of schooling outcomes. A simple theoretical model that highlights the role of comparative advantage in the optimal schooling decision is presented and used to motivate an extended discussion of econometric issues, including the properties of ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimators. A review of studies that have used compulsory schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of schools, and similar features as instrumental variables for completed education, reveals that the resulting estimates of the return to schooling are typically as big or bigger than the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates. One interpretation of this finding is that marginal returns to education among the low-education subgroups typically affected by supply-side innovations tend to be relatively high, reflecting their high marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability that limits their return to education.},

If an intervention yields a mean effect size of 50 points, we want to know if the effect size in different populations varies from 40 to 60, or from 10 to 90, because this speaks to the potential utility of the intervention. While there is a common belief that the I2 statistic provides this information, it actually does not. In this example, if we are told that I2 is 50{\%}, we have no way of knowing if the effects range from 40 to 60, or from 10 to 90, or across some other range. Rather, if we want to communicate the predicted range of effects, then we should simply report this range. This gives readers the information they think is being captured by I2 and does so in a way that is concise and unambiguous. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

This is usually interpreted as evidence that the effect sizes are heterogeneous. A random-effects model is then often used to account for the heterogeneity in the effect sizes. A novel method for constructing confidence intervals for the amount of heterogeneity in the effect sizes is proposed that guarantees nominal coverage probabilities even in small samples when model assumptions are satisfied. A variety of existing approaches for constructing such confidence intervals are summarized and the various methods are applied to an example to illustrate their use. A simulation study reveals that the newly proposed method yields the most accurate coverage probabilities under conditions more analogous to practice, where assumptions about normally distributed effect size estimates and known sampling variances only hold asymptotically.

	abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the X2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The unobserved factors and the individual-specific errors are allowed to follow arbitrary stationary processes, and the number of unobserved factors need not be estimated. The basic idea is to filter the individual-specific regressors by means of cross-section averages such that asymptotically as the cross-section dimension (N) tends to infinity, the differential effects of unobserved common factors are eliminated. The estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by least squares applied to auxiliary regressions where the observed regressors are augmented with cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and the individual-specific regressors. A number of estimators (referred to as common correlated effects (CCE) estimators) are proposed and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The small sample properties of mean group and pooled CCE estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, showing that the CCE estimators have satisfactory small sample properties even under a substantial degree of heterogeneity and dynamics, and for relatively small values of N and T.},

This has important implications for climate policy. If carbon emissions are abated, damages are avoided almost immediately. Therefore it is optimal to reduce emissions significantly in the near term and bring about a slow transition to optimal peak warming, even if optimal steady-state/peak warming is high.

However, even for basic least squares model averaging, many theoretical problems have not been well addressed yet. This article discusses asymptotic properties of a class of least squares model averaging methods with nested candidate models that includes the Mallows model averaging (MMA) of Hansen (2007, Econometrica 75, 1175-1189) as a special case. Two scenarios are considered: (i) all candidate models are under-fitted; and (ii) the true model is included in the candidate models. We find that in the first scenario, the least squares model averaging method asymptotically assigns weight one to the largest candidate model and the resulting model averaging estimator is asymptotically normal. In the second scenario with a slightly special weight space, if the penalty factor in the weight selection criterion is diverging with certain order, the model averaging estimator is asymptotically optimal by putting weight one to the true model. However, MMA with fixed model dimensions is not asymptotically optimal since it puts nonnegligible weights to over-fitted models. The theoretical results are clearly summarized with their restrictions, and some critical implications are discussed. Monte Carlo simulations confirm our theoretical results.},

Energy touches our lives in countless ways and its costs are felt when we fill up at the gas pump, pay our home heating bills, and keep businesses both large and small running. There are long-term costs as well: to the environment, as natural resources are depleted and pollution contributes to global climate change, and to national security and independence, as many of the world's current energy sources are increasingly concentrated in geopolitically unstable regions. The country's challenge is to develop an energy portfolio that addresses these concerns while still providing sufficient, affordable energy reserves for the nation. The United States has enormous resources to put behind solutions to this energy challenge; the dilemma is to identify which solutions are the right ones. Before deciding which energy technologies to develop, and on what timeline, we need to understand them better. America's Energy Future analyzes the potential of a wide range of technologies for generation, distribution, and conservation of energy. This book considers technologies to increase energy efficiency, coal-fired power generation, nuclear power, renewable energy, oil and natural gas, and alternative transportation fuels. It offers a detailed assessment of the associated impacts and projected costs of implementing each technology and categorizes them into three time frames for implementation.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of low-income support is examined using a structural labour supply model. The approach incorporates unobserved heterogeneity, fixed costs of work, childcare costs and the detailed non-convexities of the tax and transfer system. The analysis considers purely Pareto improving reforms and also optimal design under social welfare functions with different degrees of inequality aversion. We explore the gains from tagging and also examine the case for the use of hours-contingent payments. Using the tax schedule for lone parents in the U.K. as our policy environment, the results point to a reformed non-linear tax schedule with tax credits only optimal for low earners. The results also suggest a welfare improving role for tagging according to child age and for hours-contingent payments, although the case for the latter is mitigated when hours cannot be monitored or recorded accurately by the tax authorities. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

	abstract = {This article considers a classical linear simultaneous equations model with random coefficients on the endogenous variables. Simultaneous equations models are used to study social interactions, strategic interactions between firms, and market equilibrium. Random coefficient models allow for heterogeneous marginal effects. I show that random coefficient seemingly unrelated regression models with common regressors are not point identified, which implies random coefficient simultaneous equations models are not point identified. Important features of these models, however, can be identified. For two-equation systems, I give two sets of sufficient conditions for point identification of the coefficients' marginal distributions conditional on exogenous covariates. The first allows for small support continuous instruments under tail restrictions on the distributions of unobservables which are necessary for point identification. The second requires full support instruments, but allows for nearly arbitrary distributions of unobservables. I discuss how to generalize these results to many equation systems, where I focus on linear-in-means models with heterogeneous endogenous social interaction effects. I give sufficient conditions for point identification of the distributions of these endogenous social effects. I propose a consistent nonparametric kernel estimator for these distributions based on the identification arguments. I apply my results to the Add Health data to analyse peer effects in education.},

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of empirical analysis of experiments and quasi-experiments is to inform policy decisions that determine how treatments are allocated to individuals with different observable covariates. We propose the Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) method, which estimates a treatment assignment policy by maximizing the sample analog of average social welfare over a class of candidate treatment policies. We show that, when propensity score is known, the average social welfare attained by EWM rules converges at least at n{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-1/2{\{}{\}}{\}} rate to the maximum obtainable welfare. This holds uniformly over a minimally constrained class of data distributions, and this uniform convergence rate is minimax optimal. In comparison with this benchmark rate, we examine how the uniform convergence rate of the average welfare improves or deteriorates depending on the richness of the class of candidate decision rules, on the distribution of conditional treatment effects, on the lack of knowledge for the propensity score, and on additional smoothness assumptions for the regression functions or propensity scores. We also discuss practically implementable computation for the EWM rule. As an empirical application, we derive an EWM rule for the a training program using the experiment data analyzed in La Londe (1986).},

We show how to nonparametrically estimate the expected value of taxable income imposing all the restrictions of utility maximization and allowing for measurement errors.

	abstract = {We propose a two-stage procedure for estimating the location $\mu$ and size M of the maximum of a smooth d-variate regression function f. In the first stage, a preliminary estimator of $\mu$ obtained from a standard nonparametric smoothing method is used. At the second stage, we "zoom-in" near the vicinity of the preliminary estimator and make further observations at some design points in that vicinity. We fit an appropriate polynomial regression model to estimate the location and size of the maximum. We establish that, under suitable smoothness conditions and appropriate choice of the zooming, the second stage estimators have better convergence rates than the corresponding first stage estimators of $\mu$ and M. More specifically, for $\alpha$-smooth regression functions, the optimal nonparametric rates n -($\alpha$-1)/(2$\alpha$+d)and n -$\alpha$/(2$\alpha$+d) at the first stage can be improved to n -($\alpha$-1)/(2$\alpha$) and n-1/2, respectively, for $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 1 + v1 +d/2. These rates are optimal in the class of all possible sequential estimators. Interestingly, the two-stage procedure resolves "the curse of the dimensionality" problem to some extent, as the dimension d does not control the second stage convergence rates, provided that the function class is sufficiently smooth. We consider a multi-stage generalization of our procedure that attains the optimal rate for any smoothness level $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 2 starting with a preliminary estimator with any power-law rate at the first stage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

Our approach employs series approximations that exploit the additive structure of the model. The first step comprises the nonparametric estimation of the reduced form and the corresponding residuals. The second step is the estimation of the primary equation via nonparametric regression with the reduced form residuals included as a regressor. We derive consistency and asymptotic normality results for our estimator, including optimal convergence rates. Finally we present an empirical example, based on the relationship between the hourly wage rate and annual hours worked, which illustrates the utility of our approach.},

Identification does not require that the researcher have access to an instrument that is uncorrelated with the unobserved heterogeneity. Instead the identification strategy relies on an assumption that some lags and leads of observables are independent conditional on the unobserved heterogeneity and some controls. The identification strategy motivates an estimation procedure based on penalized sieve minimum distance estimation in the non-parametric instrumental variables framework. We give conditions under which the estimator is consistent and derive its rate of convergence. We present Monte Carlo evidence of its efficacy in finite samples.},

As a consequence, MIDAS regressions might be less efficient, but could also be less prone to parameter estimation error and/or specification errors. We examine how MIDAS regressions and Kalman filters match up under ideal circumstances, that is in population, and in cases where all the stochastic processes-low and high frequency-are correctly specified. We characterize cases where the MIDAS regression exactly replicates the steady state Kalman filter weights. We compare MIDAS and Kalman filter forecasts in population where the state space model is misspecified. We also compare MIDAS and Kalman filter forecasts in small samples. The paper concludes with an empirical application. Overall we find that the MIDAS and Kalman filter methods give similar forecasts. In most cases, the Kalman filter is a bit more accurate, but it is also computationally much more demanding. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Three differences between the approaches are identified: (1) MIDAS is a direct multi-step nowcasting tool, whereas bridge equations provide iterated forecasts; (2) the weighting of high-frequency predictor observations in MIDAS is based on functional lag polynomials, whereas the bridge equation weights are fixed partly by time aggregation; (3) for parameter estimation, the MIDAS equations consider current-quarter leads of high-frequency indicators, whereas bridge equations typically do not. To assist in discussing the differences between the approaches in isolation, intermediate specifications between MIDAS and bridge equations are provided. The alternative models are compared in an empirical application to nowcasting GDP growth in the Euro area, given a large set of business cycle indicators.},

The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive updated summary of the literature on latent common factors extracted using KFS procedures in the context of dynamic factor models, pointing out their potential limitations. Signal extraction and parameter estimation issues are separately analyzed. Identification issues are also tackled in both stationary and non-stationary models. Finally, empirical applications are surveyed in both cases. This survey is relevant to researchers and practitioners interested not only in the theory of KFS procedures for factor extraction in dynamic factor models but also in their empirical application in macroeconomics and finance.},

	abstract = {In this article, we merge two strands from the recent econometric literature. First, factor models based on large sets of macroeconomic variables for forecasting, which have generally proven useful for forecasting. However, there is some disagreement in the literature as to the appropriate method. Second, forecast methods based on mixed-frequency data sampling (MIDAS). This regression technique can take into account unbalanced datasets that emerge from publication lags of high- and low-frequency indicators, a problem practitioner have to cope with in real time. In this article, we introduce Factor MIDAS, an approach for nowcasting and forecasting low-frequency variables like gross domestic product (GDP) exploiting information in a large set of higher-frequency indicators. We consider three alternative MIDAS approaches (basic, smoothed and unrestricted) that provide harmonized projection. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics, University of Oxford, 2010.},

The regressions differ in the specification of regressors (squared returns, absolute returns, realized volatility, realized power, and return ranges), in the use of daily or intra-daily (5-min) data, and in the length of the past history included in the forecasts. The MIDAS framework allows us to compare regressions across all these dimensions in a very tightly parameterized fashion. Using equity return data, we find that daily realized power (involving 5-min absolute returns) is the best predictor of future volatility (measured by increments in quadratic variation) and outperforms models based on realized volatility (i.e. past increments in quadratic variation). Surprisingly, the direct use of high-frequency (5 min) data does not improve volatility predictions. Finally, daily lags of 1-2 months are sufficient to capture the persistence in volatility. These findings hold both in- and out-of-sample. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Garcia-Ferrer1987,
	abstract = {Introduction It has long been recognized that national economies are economically interdependent (see, e.g., Burns and Mitchell 1946 for evidence of comovements of business activity in several countries and Zarnowitz 1985 for a summary of recent evidence). Recognition of such interdependence raises the question: Can such interdependence be exploited econometrically to produce improved forecasts of countries' macroeconomic variables such as rates of growth of output, and so forth? This is the problem that we address in this chapter, using annual and quarterly data for a sample of European Economic Community (EEC) countries and the United States. We recognize that there are several alternative approaches to the problem of obtaining improved international macroeconomic forecasts. First, there is the approach of Project Link that attempts to link together elaborate structural models of national economies in an effort to produce a world structural econometric model. A recent report on this ambitious effort was given by Klein (1985). We refer to this approach as a “top-down” approach, since it uses highly elaborate country models to approach the international forecasting problem. In our work, we report results based on a “bottom-up” approach that involves examining the properties of particular macroeconomic time series variables, building simple forecasting models for them, and appraising the quality of forecasts yielded by them. We regard this as a first step in the process of constructing more elaborate models in the structural econometric modeling time series analysis (SEMTSA) approach described by Palm (1983), Zellner (1979), and Zellner and Palm (1974).},

@article{Kim2014,
	abstract = {In this paper, we empirically assess the predictive accuracy of a large group of models that are specified using principle components and other shrinkage techniques, including Bayesian model averaging and various bagging, boosting, least angle regression and related methods. Our results suggest that model averaging does not dominate other well designed prediction model specification methods, and that using "hybrid" combination factor/shrinkage methods often yields superior predictions. More specifically, when using recursive estimation windows, which dominate other "windowing" approaches, "hybrid" models are mean square forecast error "best" around 1/3 of the time, when used to predict 11 key macroeconomic indicators at various forecast horizons. Baseline linear (factor) models also "win" around 1/3 of the time, as do model averaging methods. Interestingly, these broad findings change noticeably when considering different sub-samples. For example, when used to predict only recessionary periods, "hybrid" models "win" in 7 of 11 cases, when condensing findings across all "windowing" approaches, estimation methods, and models, while model averaging does not "win" in a single case. However, in expansions, and during the 1990s, model averaging wins almost 1/2 of the time. Overall, combination factor/shrinkage methods "win" approximately 1/2 of the time in 4 of 6 different sample periods. Ancillary findings based on our forecasting experiments underscore the advantages of using recursive estimation strategies, and provide new evidence of the usefulness of yield and yield-spread variables in nonlinear prediction model specification. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There are many other applications and classical IV models arise as a special case. The chapter provides characterizations of the identified sets delivered by GIV models. It gives details of the application of GIV analysis to models with an interval censored endogenous variable and to binary outcome models – for example probit models – with endogenous explanatory variables. It illustrates how the identified sets delivered by GIV models can be represented by moment inequality characterizations that have been the focus of recently developed methods for inference.

@article{Andrews2010,
	abstract = {This paper analyzes the properties of subsampling, hybrid subsampling, and size-correction methods in two non-regular models. The latter two procedures are introduced in Andrews and Guggenberger (2009a). The models are non-regular in the sense that the test statistics of interest exhibit a discontinuity in their limit distribution as a function of a parameter in the model. The first model is a linear instrumental variables (IV) model with possibly weak IVs estimated using two-stage least squares (2SLS). In this case, the discontinuity occurs when the concentration parameter is zero. The second model is a linear regression model in which the parameter of interest may be near a boundary. In this case, the discontinuity occurs when the parameter is on the boundary. The paper shows that in the IV model one-sided and equal-tailed two-sided subsampling tests and confidence intervals (CIs) based on the 2SLS t statistic do not have correct asymptotic size. This holds for both fully- and partially-studentized t statistics. But, subsampling procedures based on the partially-studentized t statistic can be size-corrected. On the other hand, symmetric two-sided subsampling tests and CIs are shown to have (essentially) correct asymptotic size when based on a partially-studentized t statistic. Furthermore, all types of hybrid subsampling tests and CIs are shown to have correct asymptotic size in this model. The above results are consistent with "impossibility" results of Dufour (1997) because subsampling and hybrid subsampling CIs are shown to have infinite length with positive probability. Subsampling CIs for a parameter that may be near a lower boundary are shown to have incorrect asymptotic size for upper one-sided and equal-tailed and symmetric two-sided CIs. Again, size-correction is possible. In this model as well, all types of hybrid subsampling CIs are found to have correct asymptotic size. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Semiparametric panel data modelling and statistical inference with fractional stochastic trends, nonparametrically time-trending individual effects, and general cross-sectional correlation and heteroscedasticity in innovations are developed. The fractional stochastic trends allow for a wide range of nonstationarity, indexed by a memory parameter, nesting the familiar I(1) case and allowing for parametric short-memory. The individual effects can nonparametrically vary simultaneously across time and across units. The cross-sectional covariance matrix is also nonparametric. The main focus is on estimation of the time series parameters. Two methods are considered, both of which entail an only approximate differencing out of the individual effects, leaving an error which has to be taken account of in our theory. In both cases we obtain standard asymptotics, with a central limit theorem, over a wide range of possible parameter values, unlike the nonstandard asymptotics for autoregressive parameter estimates at a unit root. For statistical inference, consistent estimation of the limiting covariance matrix of the parameter estimates requires consistent estimation of a functional of the cross-sectional covariance matrix. We examine efficiency loss due to cross-sectional correlation in a spatial model example. A Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance is included.},

	abstract = {A dynamic panel data model is considered that contains possibly stochastic individual components and a common stochastic time trend that allows for stationary and nonstationary long memory and general parametric short memory. We propose four different ways of coping with the individual effects so as to estimate the parameters. Like models with autoregressive dynamics, ours nests I(1) behaviour, but unlike the nonstandard asymptotics in the autoregressive case, estimates of the fractional parameter can be asymptotically normal. For three of the estimates, establishing this property is made difficult due to bias caused by the individual effects, or by the consequences of eliminating them, which appears in the central limit theorem except under stringent conditions on the growth of the cross-sectional size N relative to the time series length T, though in case of two estimates these can be relaxed by bias correction, where the biases depend only on the parameters describing autocorrelation. For the fourth estimate, there is no bias problem, and no restrictions on N. Implications for hypothesis testing and interval estimation are discussed, with central limit theorems for feasibly bias-corrected estimates included.

The main result is that a generalized version of differencing identifies local average responses (LARs) in nonseparable structures. In contrast to existing results, this does not require either substantial restrictions on functional form or independence between the persistent unobservables and the explanatory variables of interest, and it requires only two time periods. On the other hand, the results are confined to the subpopulation of "stayers" (Chamberlain, 1982), i.e.; the population for which the explanatory variables do not change over time. We extend the basic framework to include time trends and dynamics in the explanatory variables, and we show how distributional effects as well as average partial effects are identified. Our approach also allows endogeneity in the transitory unobservables. Furthermore, we show that this new identification principle can be applied to well-known objects like the slope coefficient in the semiparametric panel data binary choice model with fixed effects. Finally, we suggest estimators for the local average response and average partial effect, and we analyze their large- and finite-sample behavior. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the second step, we estimate the conditional expectation of the outcomes given the indices and a generated regressor that depends on first-step estimates.

The model does not employ large support, special regressor, or control function restrictions; indeed, it is silent about the process that delivers values of endogenous explanatory variables, and in this respect it is incomplete. Instead, the model employs instrumental variable restrictions that require the existence of instrumental variables that are excluded from latent utilities and distributed independently of the unobserved components of utilities. We show that the model delivers set identification of latent utility functions and the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity, and we characterize sharp bounds on these objects. We develop easy-to-compute outer regions that, in parametric models, require little more calculation than what is involved in a conventional maximum likelihood analysis. The results are illustrated using a model that is essentially the conditional logit model of 41, but with potentially endogenous explanatory variables and instrumental variable restrictions.

Examples include levels of obesity, seriousness of a health condition, attitudes towards service levels, opinions on products, voting intentions, and the degree of clarity of contracts. Ordered choice models provide a relevant methodology for capturing the sources of influence that explain the choice made amongst a set of ordered alternatives. The methods have evolved to a level of sophistication that can allow for heterogeneity in the threshold parameters, in the explanatory variables (through random parameters), and in the decomposition of the residual variance. This book brings together contributions in ordered choice modeling from a number of disciplines, synthesizing developments over the last fifty years, and suggests useful extensions to account for the wide range of sources of influence on choice.},

	abstract={The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of the analysis of two kinds of data structures used in contemporary econometric research: cross section data and panel data. The book covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particularly methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models, multinomial and ordered choice models, Tobit models and two-part extensions, models for count data, various censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effect estimation, and duration analysis. Control function and correlated random effects approaches are expanded to allow estimation of complicated models in the presence of endogeneity and heterogeneity. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster sampling problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of \&quot;generalized instrumental variables\&quot; (GIV) estimation; new coverage of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with assumptions concerning the intervention and different data structures, including panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the \&quot;generalized estimating equation\&quot; literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain “obvious” procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

	abstract = {When one wants to estimate a model without specifying the functions and distributions parametrically, or when one wants to analyze the identification of a model independently of any particular parametric specification, it is useful to perform a nonparametric analysis of identification. This chapter presents some of the recent results on the identification of nonparametric econometric models. It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape restrictions on distributions, and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature.},

	abstract = {RANDOM ASSIGNMENT OF TREATMENT and concurrent data collection on treatment and control groups is the norm in medical evaluation research. In contrast, the use of random assignment to evaluate social programs remains controversial. Following criticism of parametric evaluation models (e.g., Lalonde (1986)), econometric research has been geared towards establishing conditions that guarantee nonparametric identification of treatment effects in observational studies, i.e. identification without relying on functional form restrictions or distributional assumptions. The focus has been on identification of average treatment effects in a population of interest, or on the average effect for the subpopulation that is treated. The conditions required to nonparametrically identify these parameters can be restrictive, however, and the derived identification results fragile. In particular, results in Chamberlain (1986), Manski (1990), Heckman (1990), and Angrist and Imbens (1991) require that there be some subpopulation for whom the probability of treatment is zero, at least in the limit. The purpose of this paper is to show that even when there is no subpopulation available for whom the probability of treatment is zero, we can still identify an average treatment effect of interest under mild restrictions satisfied in a wide range of models and circumstances. We call this a local average treatment effect (LATE). Examples of problems where the local average treatment effect is identified include latent index models and evaluations based on natural experiments such as those studied by Angrist (1990) and Angrist and Krueger (1991). LATE is the average treatment effect for individuals whose treatment status is influenced by changing an exogenous regressor that satisfies an exclusion restriction.},

The relationship is very strong when x is continuous, weaker when x is discrete, and non-existent as the order of the distributed lag becomes infinite. The individual specific random variables introduce nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity; so the paper provides an appropriate framework for the estimation of multivariate linear predictors. Restrictions are imposed using a minimum distance estimator. It is generally more efficient than the conventional estimators such as quasi-maximum likelihood. There are computationally simple generalizations of two- and three-stage least squares that achieve this efficiency gain. Some of these ideas are illustrated using the sample of Young Men in the National Longitudinal Survey. The paper reports regressions on the leads and lags of variables measuring union coverage, SMSA, and region. The results indicate that the leads and lags could have been generated just by a random intercept. This gives some support for analysis of covariance type estimates; these estimates indicate a substantial heterogeneity bias in the union, SMSA, and region coefficients. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

This paper gives identification and estimation results for nonseparable models under time homogeneity conditions that are like "time is randomly assigned" or "time is an instrument." Partial identification results for average and quantile effects are given for discrete regressors, under static or dynamic conditions, in fully nonparametric and in semiparametric models, with time effects. It is shown that the usual, linear, fixed-effects estimator is not a consistent estimator of the identified average effect, and a consistent estimator is given. A simple estimator of identified quantile treatment effects is given, providing a solution to the important problem of estimating quantile treatment effects from panel data. Bounds for overall effects in static and dynamic models are given. The dynamic bounds provide a partial identification solution to the important problem of estimating the effect of state dependence in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The impact of {\$}T{\$}, the number of time periods, is shown by deriving shrinkage rates for the identified set as {\$}T{\$} grows. We also consider semiparametric, discrete-choice models and find that semiparametric panel bounds can be much tighter than nonparametric bounds.

We contribute to the existing literature by focusing on the heterogeneity of the impact of reforms. Our results indicate that increased compulsory education from seven to nine years increased the general level of education beyond the compulsory education. We also find that the effect of family background on educational attainment was weaker after the reform. The average treatment effect on returns to education is surprisingly high for education of intermediate duration. This means that increasing the general level of education potentially generates high returns in the form of wages. We also find that the effect of treatment on the treated on the returns to education is 1-4 percentage points higher than the average treatment effect. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Auld2005,
	abstract = {A large literature documents a strong correlation between health and educational outcomes. In this paper we investigate the role of cognitive ability in the health-education nexus. Using NLSY data, we show that one standard deviation increase in cognitive ability is associated with roughly the same increase in health as two years of schooling and that cognitive ability accounts for roughly one quarter of the association between schooling and health. Both schooling and ability are strongly associated with health at low levels but less related or unrelated at high levels. Estimates treating schooling as endogenous to health suggest that much of the correlation between schooling and health is attributable to unobserved heterogeneity; the causal effect of schooling on health is large only for respondents with low levels of schooling and low cognitive ability. An implication is that policies which increase schooling will only increase health to the extent that they increase the education of poorly-educated individuals. Subsidies to college education, for example, are unlikely to increase population health. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

It is shown that under relevant forms of systematic slope variations (i) the pooled OLS estimator is severely biased, (ii) Swamy's GLS estimator is inconsistent if the number of time periods T is fixed, whereas (iii) the mean-group estimator always provides consistent estimators at the risk of high variances. Following Mundlak (1978) we propose an augmentated regression which results in a simple and robust version of the pooled estimator. The latter approach avoids the risk of large standard errors of the mean-group estimator, whenever T is small. We also propose two test statistics for systematic slope variation using the Lagrange multiplier and Hausman principles. We derive their asymptotic properties and provide a local power analysis of both test statistics. Monte Carlo experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and show that for all combinations of N and T the Mundlak-type GLS estimator outperform all other estimators.},

	abstract = {Counterfactual distributions are important ingredients for policy analysis and decomposition analysis in empirical economics. In this article we develop modeling and inference tools for counterfactual distributions based on regression methods. The counterfactual scenarios that we consider consist of ceteris paribus changes in either the distribution of covariates related to the outcome of interest or the conditional distribution of the outcome given covariates. For either of these scenarios we derive joint functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for regression-based estimators of the status quo and counterfactual outcome distributions. These results allow us to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued effects of the counterfactual changes, including the effects on the entire distribution and quantile functions of the outcome as well as on related functionals. These confidence sets can be used to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect, positive effect, or stochastic dominance. Our theory applies to general counterfactual changes and covers the main regression methods including classical, quantile, duration, and distribution regressions. We illustrate the results with an empirical application to wage decompositions using data for the United States. As a part of developing the main results, we introduce distribution regression as a comprehensive and flexible tool for modeling and estimating the $\backslash$textit{\{}entire{\}} conditional distribution. We show that distribution regression encompasses the Cox duration regression and represents a useful alternative to quantile regression. We establish functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for the empirical distribution regression process and various related functionals.},

Two main explanations have been offered: firm selection (larger cities toughen competition, allowing only the most productive to survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote interactions that increase productivity), possibly reinforced by localized natural advantage. To distinguish between them, we nest a generalized version of a tractable firm selection model and a standard model of agglomeration. Stronger selection in larger cities left-truncates the productivity distribution, whereas stronger agglomeration right-shifts and dilates the distribution. Using this prediction, French establishment-level data, and a new quantile approach, we show that firm selection cannot explain spatial productivity differences.

The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation.

@article{Williamson1990,
	abstract = {Probabilistic arithmetic involves the calculation of the distribution of arithmetic functions of random variables. This work on probabilistic arithmetic began as an investigation into the possibility of adapting existing numerical procedures (developed for fixed numbers) to handle random variables (by replacing the basic operations of arithmetic by the appropriate convolutions). The general idea is similar to interval arithmetic and fuzzy arithmetic. In this paper we present a new and general numerical method for calculating the appropriate convolutions of a wide range of probability distributions. An important feature of the method is the manner in which the probability distributions are represented. We use lower and upper discrete approximations to the quantile function (the quasi-inverse of the distribution function). This results in any representation error being always contained within the lower and upper bounds. This method of representation has advantages over other methods previously proposed. The representation fits in well with the idea of dependency bounds. Stochastic dependencies that arise within the course of a sequence of operations on random variables are the severest limit to the simple application of convolution algorithms to the formation of a general probabilistic arithmetic. We examine this dependency error and show how dependency bounds are a possible means of reducing its effect. Dependency bounds are lower and upper bounds on the distribution of a function of random variables that contain the true distribution even when nothing is known of the dependence of the random variables. They are based on the Fr{\'{e}}chet inequalities for the joint distribution of a set of random variables in terms of their marginal distributions. We show how the dependency bounds can be calculated numerically using our numerical representation of probability distributions. Examples of the methods developed are presented, and relationships with other work on numerically handling uncertainties are briefly described. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

Quantiles and other functionals of the distribution of treatment effect are only partially identified. Bounds on a single quantile and on the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) in a single point are sharp (Makarov bounds). We show that bounds on functionals of the quantile process that use Makarov bounds are not sharp, because the Makarov bounds are pointwise, but not uniformly sharp. This allows us to propose improved bounds on functionals of the c.d.f. As an intermediate result, we find that the Makarov bounds on the region that contains the c.d.f. of the treatment effect distribution in a finite number of points can be improved. We provide numerical illustrations throughout the paper permitting a clear visualization of how the method works.},

	abstract = {Nonparametric methods play a central role in modern empirical work. While they provide inference procedures that are more robust to parametric misspecification bias, they may be quite sensitive to tuning parameter choices. We study the effects of bias correction on confidence interval coverage in the context of kernel density and local polynomial regression estimation, and prove that bias correction can be preferred to undersmoothing for minimizing coverage error and increasing robustness to tuning parameter choice. This is achieved using a novel, yet simple, Studentization, which leads to a new way of constructing kernel-based bias-corrected confidence intervals. In addition, for practical cases, we derive coverage error optimal bandwidths and discuss easy-to-implement bandwidth selectors. For interior points, we show that the mean-squared error (MSE)-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator (before bias correction) delivers the fastest coverage error decay rate after bias correction when second-order (equivalent) kernels are employed, but is otherwise suboptimal because it is too “large.” Finally, for odd-degree local polynomial regression, we show that, as with point estimation, coverage error adapts to boundary points automatically when appropriate Studentization is used; however, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator is suboptimal. All the results are established using valid Edgeworth expansions and illustrated with simulated data. Our findings have important consequences for empirical work as they indicate that bias-corrected confidence intervals, coupled with appropriate standard errors, have smaller coverage error and are less sensitive to tuning parameter choices in practically relevant cases where additional smoothness is available.

We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

	abstract = {Building on an idea in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), this article investigates the application of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Statistical Association.},

It is concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of a real function of a real variable x which is 'close' to a power of x. Such functions are much more than a convenient extension of powers. In many limit theorems regular variation is intrinsic to the result, and exactly characterises the limit behaviour. The book emphasises such characterisations, and gives a comprehensive treatment of those applications where regular variation plays an essential (rather then merely convenient) role. The authors rigorously develop the basic ideas of Karamata theory and de Haan theory including many new results and 'second-order' theorems. They go on to discuss the role of regular variation in Abelian, Tauberian, and Mercerian theorems. These results are then applied in analytic number theory, complex analysis, and probability, with the aim above all of setting the theory in context. A widely scattered literature is thus brought together in a unified approach. With several appendices and a comprehensive list of references, analysts, number theorists, and probabilists will find this an invaluable and complete account of regular variation. It will provide a rigorous and authoritative introduction to the subject for research students in these fields.},

This criterion is quadratic in the weights, so computation is a simple application of quadratic programming. We show that our estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible expected squared error. Monte Carlo simulations and an illustrative application show that JMA can achieve significant efficiency gains over existing model selection and averaging methods in the presence of heteroskedasticity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Outside the normal linear mixed models, exact calculations are not available and we resort to asymptotic approximations. In the presence of nuisance parameters, a profile conditional Akaike information is proposed. Bootstrap methods are considered for their potential advantage in finite samples. Simulations show that the performance of the bootstrap and the analytic criteria are comparable, with bootstrap demonstrating some advantages for larger cluster sizes.

The subsampling methodology hinges on approximating the large-sample distribution of a statistic Tn = Tn(X1,{\ldots}, Xn) that is consistent for $\theta$ at some known rate $\tau$n. Although subsampling has been shown to yield confidence regions for $\theta$ of asymptotically correct coverage under very weak assumptions, the applicability of the methodology as it has been presented so far is limited if the rate of convergence $\tau$n happens to be unknown or intractable in a particular setting. In this article we show how it is possible to circumvent this limitation by (a) using the subsampling methodology to derive a consistent estimator of the rate $\tau$n, and (b) using the estimated rate to construct asymptotically correct confidence regions for $\theta$ based on subsampling. {\textcopyright} 1999 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

We study the possible limit functions in this limit relation (denning generalized regular variation of second order) and their domains of attraction.

	abstract = {This article develops a unifying framework, as well as robust meta-analysis approaches, for combining studies from independent sources. The device used in this combination is a confidence distribution (CD), which uses a distribution function, instead of a point (point estimator) or an interval (confidence interval), to estimate a parameter of interest. A CD function contains a wealth of information for inferences, and it is a useful device for combining studies from different sources. The proposed combining framework not only unifies most existing metaanalysis approaches, but also leads to development of new approaches. We illustrate in this article that this combining framework can include both the classical methods of combining p-values and modern model-based meta-analysis approaches. We also develop, under the unifying framework, two new robust meta-analysis approaches, with supporting asymptotic theory. In one approach each study size goes to infinity, and in the other approach the number of studies goes to infinity. Our theoretical development suggests that both these robust meta-analysis approaches have high breakdown points and are highly efficient for normal models. The new methodologies are applied to study-level data from publications on prophylactic use of lidocaine in heart attacks and a treatment of stomach ulcers. The robust methods performed well when data are contaminated and have realistic sample sizes and number of studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Statistical Association.},

The weight matrix used in the calculation of the efficient two-step GMM estimator is based on initial consistent parameter estimates. In this paper it is shown that the extra variation due to the presence of these estimated parameters in the weight matrix accounts for much of the difference between the finite sample and the usual asymptotic variance of the two-step GMM estimator, when the moment conditions used are linear in the parameters. This difference can be estimated, resulting in a finite sample corrected estimate of the variance. In a Monte Carlo study of a panel data model it is shown that the corrected variance estimate approximates the finite sample variance well, leading to more accurate inference. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Extremal QR, or QR applied to the tails, is of interest in many economic and financial applications, such as conditional value at risk, production efficiency, and adjustment bands in (S, s) models. This paper provides feasible inference tools for extremal conditional quantile models that rely on extreme value approximations to the distribution of self-normalized QR statistics. The methods are simple to implement and can be of independent interest even in the univariate (non-regression) case. We illustrate the results with two empirical examples analysing extreme fluctuations of a stock return and extremely low percentiles of live infant birthweight in the range between 250 and 1500 g. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

We study the asymptotic behaviour of such estimators with a scale and location invariant functional T under weak second order conditions on F. For that purpose first a new approximation of the empirical tail quantile function is established. As a consequence we obtain weak consistency and asymptotic normality of T(Qn) if T is continuous and Hadamard differentiable, respectively, at the upper quantile function of a generalized Pareto distribution and kn tends to infinity sufficiently slowly. Then we investigate the asymptotic variance and bias. In particular, those functionals T are characterized that lead to an estimator with minimal asymptotic variance. Finally, we introduce a method to construct estimators of the extreme value index with a made-to-order asymptotic behaviour.},

We also decompose the capital shares into the income shares of land, structures, and equipment. We find that the capital shares differ across sectors. For example, the capital share of agriculture is more than two times that of construction and more than 50{\%} larger than that of the aggregate economy. Moreover, agriculture has by far the largest land share, which mostly explains why it has the largest capital share. Our numbers can directly be used to calibrate standard multi-sector models. Alternatively, if one wants to abstract from differences in sector capital shares, our numbers can be used to establish that this is not crucial for the results. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the identification of the parameters in the presence of instrumental variables. We also focus on the estimation of $\beta$. It is known that the presence of $\phi$ may lead to a slow rate of convergence for the estimator of $\beta$. An additional complication in the fully endogenous model is that the solution of the equation necessitates the inversion of a compact operator that has to be estimated non-parametrically. In general this inversion is not stable, thus the estimation of $\beta$ is ill-posed. In this paper, a -consistent estimator for $\beta$ is derived in this setting under mild assumptions. One of these assumptions is given by the so-called source condition that is explicitly interpreted in the paper. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the reasonable performance of the estimation procedure on finite samples. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).

This paper presents evidence that heterogeneity in response to programmes is empirically important and that classical probability inequalities are not very informative in producing estimates or bounds on the distribution of programme impacts. We explore two methods for supplementing the information in these inequalities based on assumptions about participant decision-making processes and about the strength in dependence between outcomes in the participation and non-participation states. Dependence is produced as a consequence of rational choice by participants.

	abstract = {Applying extreme value statistics in meteorology and environmental science requires accurate estimators on extreme value indices that can be around zero. Without having prior knowledge on the sign of the extreme value indices, the probability weighted moment (PWM) estimator is a favorable candidate. As most other estimators on the extreme value index, the PWM estimator bears an asymptotic bias. In this paper, we develop a bias correction procedure for the PWM estimator. Moreover, we provide bias-corrected PWM estimators for high quantiles and, when the extreme value index is negative, the endpoint of a distribution. The choice of k, the number of high order statistics used for estimation, is crucial in applications. The asymptotically unbiased PWM estimators allows the choice of higher level k, which results in a lower asymptotic variance. Moreover, since the bias-corrected PWM estimators can be applied for a wider range of k compared to the original PWM estimator, one gets more flexibility in choosing k for finite sample applications. All advantages become apparent in simulations and an environmental application on estimating "once per 10,000 years" still water level at Hoek van Holland, The Netherlands. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Quantile regression is an important tool for estimation of conditional quantiles of a response Y given a vector of covariates X. It can be used to measure the effect of covariates not only in the center of a distribution, but also in the upper and lower tails. This paper develops a theory of quantile regression in the tails. Specifically, it obtains the large sample properties of extremal (extreme order and intermediate order) quantile regression estimators for the linear quantile regression model with the tails restricted to the domain of minimum attraction and closed under tail equivalence across regressor values. This modeling setup combines restrictions of extreme value theory with leading homoscedastic and heteroscedastic linear specifications of regression analysis. In large samples, extreme order regression quantiles converge weakly to arg min functionals of stochastic integrals of Poisson processes that depend on regressors, while intermediate regression quantiles and their functionals converge to normal vectors with variance matrices dependent on the tail parameters and the regressor design. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2005.},

	abstract = {In 1895, the Italian econometrician Vilfredo Pareto discovered that the power law describes well the tails of income and wealth data. This simple observation stimulated further applications of the power law to economic data, including Zipf (1949), Mandelbrot (1963), Fama (1965), Praetz (1972), Sen (1973), and Longin (1996), among many others. It also led to a theory to analyze the properties of the tails of the distributions, so-called extreme value (EV) theory, which was developed by Gnedenko (1943) and deHaan (1970). Jansen and de Vries (1991) applied this theory to analyze the tail properties of US financial returns and concluded that the 1987 market crash was not an outlier; rather, it was a rare event whose magnitude could have been predicted by prior data. This work stimulated numerous other studies that rigorously documented the tail properties of economic data (Embrechts et al., 1997).},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a standardized version of Swamy's test of slope homogeneity for panel data models where the cross section dimension (N) could be large relative to the time series dimension (T). The proposed test, denoted by over($\Delta$, ̃), exploits the cross section dispersion of individual slopes weighted by their relative precision. In the case of models with strictly exogenous regressors, but with non-normally distributed errors, the test is shown to have a standard normal distribution as (N, T)over(→, j) ∞ such that sqrt(N) / T2 → 0. When the errors are normally distributed, a mean-variance bias adjusted version of the test is shown to be normally distributed irrespective of the relative expansion rates of N and T. The test is also applied to stationary dynamic models, and shown to be valid asymptotically so long as N / T → $\kappa$, as (N, T) over(→, j) ∞, where 0 ≤ $\kappa$ {\textless} ∞. Using Monte Carlo experiments, it is shown that the test has the correct size and satisfactory power in panels with strictly exogenous regressors for various combinations of N and T. Similar results are also obtained for dynamic panels, but only if the autoregressive coefficient is not too close to unity and so long as T ≥ N. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Standard econometric methods can overlook individual heterogeneity in empirical work, generating inconsistent parameter estimates in panel data models. We propose the use of methods that allow researchers to easily identify, quantify, and address estimation issues arising from individual slope heterogeneity. We first characterize the bias in the standard fixed effects estimator when the true econometric model allows for heterogeneous slope coefficients. We then introduce a new test to check whether the fixed effects estimation is subject to heterogeneity bias. The procedure tests the population moment conditions required for fixed effects to consistently estimate the relevant parameters in the model. We establish the limiting distribution of the test and show that it is very simple to implement in practice. Examining firm investment models to showcase our approach, we show that heterogeneity bias-robust methods identify cash flow as a more important driver of investment than previously reported. Our study demonstrates analytically, via simulations, and empirically the importance of carefully accounting for individual specific slope heterogeneity in drawing conclusions about economic behavior.},

@article{Guggenberger2010,
	abstract = {This paper investigates the asymptotic size properties of a two-stage test in the linear instrumental variables model when in the first stage a Hausman (1978) specification test is used as a pretest of exogeneity of a regressor. In the second stage, a simple hypothesis about a component of the structural parameter vector is tested, using a t-statistic that is based on either the ordinary least squares (OLS) or the two-stage least squares estimator (2SLS), depending on the outcome of the Hausman pretest. The asymptotic size of the two-stage test is derived in a model where weak instruments are ruled out by imposing a positive lower bound on the strength of the instruments. The asymptotic size equals 1 for empirically relevant choices of the parameter space. The size distortion is caused by a discontinuity of the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic in the correlation parameter between the structural and reduced form error terms. The Hausman pretest does not have sufficient power against correlations that are local to zero while the OLS-based t-statistic takes on large values for such nonzero correlations. Instead of using the two-stage procedure, the recommendation then is to use a t-statistic based on the 2SLS estimator or, if weak instruments are a concern, the conditional likelihood ratio test by Moreira (2003). {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press, 2009.},

We revisit his proposal by investigating Stein-like shrinkage in the context of two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation of a structural parameter. Our estimator follows Maasoumi (1978) in taking a weighted average of the 2SLS and ordinary least square estimators, with the weight depending inversely on the Hausman (1978) statistic for exogeneity. Using a local-to-exogenous asymptotic theory, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the Stein estimator and calculate its asymptotic risk. We find that if the number of endogenous variables exceeds 2, then the shrinkage estimator has strictly smaller risk than the 2SLS estimator, extending the classic result of James and Stein (1961). In a simple simulation experiment, we show that the shrinkage estimator has substantially reduced finite sample median squared error relative to the standard 2SLS estimator.},

	abstract = {This article considers fixed effects (FE) estimation for linear panel data models under possible model misspecification when both the number of individuals, n, and the number of time periods, T, are large. We first clarify the probability limit of the FE estimator and argue that this probability limit can be regarded as a pseudo-true parameter. We then establish the asymptotic distributional properties of the FE estimator around the pseudo-true parameter when n and T jointly go to infinity. Notably, we show that the FE estimator suffers from the incidental parameters bias of which the top order is O(T− 1), and even after the incidental parameters bias is completely removed, the rate of convergence of the FE estimator depends on the degree of model misspecification and is either (nT)− 1/2 or n− 1/2. Second, we establish asymptotically valid inference on the (pseudo-true) parameter. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic properties of the clustered covariance matrix (CCM) estimator and the cross-section bootstrap, and show that they are robust to model misspecification. This establishes a rigorous theoretical ground for the use of the CCM estimator and the cross-section bootstrap when model misspecification and the incidental parameters bias (in the coefficient estimate) are present. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the finite sample performance of the estimators and inference methods, together with a simple application to the unemployment dynamics in the U.S.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper a method of estimating the parameters of a set of regression equations is reported which involves application of Aitken's generalized least-squares [1] to the whole system of equations. Under conditions generally encountered in practice, it is found that the regression coefficient estimators so obtained are at least asymptotically more efficient than those obtained by an equation-by-equation application of least squares. This gain in efficiency can be quite large if ?independent? variables in different equations are not highly correlated and if disturbance terms in different equations are highly correlated. Further, tests of the hypothesis that all regression equation coefficient vectors are equal, based on ?micro? and ?macro? data, are described. If this hypothesis is accepted, there will be no aggregation bias. Finally, the estimation procedure and the ?micro-test? for aggregation bias are applied in the analysis of annual investment data, 1935?1954, for two firms.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The results are applied to testing the serial independence of the disturbances in a regression model where some of the regressors are lagged dependent variables. It is shown that the asymptotic distribution of the lag-1 serial correlation coefficient calculated from the least-squares residuals differs from that of the coefficient calculated from the true disturbances. A consequence of this is that tests of serial independence based on the residuals from regression on fixed regressors are invalid when applied to models containing lagged dependent variables even when the null hypothesis of serial independence is true. Tests which are asymptotically valid for the large-sample case are suggested.},

	abstract = {Consider an economic agent whose preferences change over time. In this paper we would like to address ourselves to the question of how such an agent might behave and whether or not he can escape the predicament of yesterday's actions being non-optimal, when viewed from the vantage point of today's preferences. Before we embark on this discussion, we must acknowledge the fact that, from the methodological point of view, the whole question of preferences that change over time is, at the outset, rather troublesome. An agent's preference ordering is nothing more than a summary of his choices, when confronted with dichotomous alternatives. As such, preferences are an ex-post concept, and there is a real methodological difficulty in talking today about tomorrow's preferences, since tomorrow's preferences only become meaningful after tomorrow's potential choices are known. A case can therefore be made to the effect that the assumption of constant preferences is the only possible one in economic theory. Nevertheless, we shall speak here of preferences that change in a way that is known in advance, thus knowingly placing ourselves on shaky methodological ground. But changing tastes, such as through the formation of fads, fashions, and habits, is a real phenomenon and we feel that it is worthy of examination, even at the cost of a certain amount of methodological deficiency.

@article{Deaton1980,
	abstract = {Ever since Richard Stone first estimated a system of demand equations derived explicitly from consumer theory, there has been a continuing search for alternative specifications and functional forms. Many models have been proposed, but perhaps the most important in current use, apart from the original linear expenditure system, are the Rotterdam model and the translog model. Both of these models have been extensively estimated and have, in addition, been used to test the homogeneity and symmetry restrictions of demand theory. In this paper, we propose and estimate a new model which is of comparable generality to the Rotterdam and translog models but which has considerable advantages over both. The model, which we call the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), gives an arbitrary first-order approximation to any demand system; it satisfies the axioms of choice exactly; it aggregates perfectly over consumers without invoking parallel linear Engel curves; it has a functional form which is consistent with known household-budget data; it is simple to estimate, largely avoiding the need for non-linear estimation; and it can be used to test the restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry through linear restrictions on fixed parameters.},

The free-rider problem implies a new role for the principal: administering incentive schemes that do not balance the budget. This new role is essential for controlling incentives and suggests that firms in which ownership and labor are partly separated will have an advantage over partnerships in which output is distributed among agents. A new characterization of informative (hence valuable) monitoring is derived and applied to analyze the value of relative performance evaluation. It is shown that competition among agents (due to relative evaluations) has merit solely as a device to extract information optimally. Competition per se is worthless. The role of aggregate measures in relative performance evaluation is also explored, and the implications for investment rules are discussed.},

The resultant motivation losses were termed "free-rider effects." In Exp I, 189 undergraduates of high or low ability performed in 2-, 4-, or 8-person groups at tasks with additive, conjunctive, or disjunctive demands. As predicted, member ability had opposite effects on effort under disjunctive and conjunctive task demands. The failure to obtain a relationship between group size and member effort in Exp I was attributed to a procedural artifact eliminated in Exp II (73 Ss). As predicted, as groups performing conjunctive and disjunctive tasks increased in size, member motivation declined. This was not a social loafing effect; group members were fully identifiable at every group size. Exp III (108 Ss) explored the role that performance feedback plays in informing group members of the dispensability of their efforts and encouraging free riding. Results are generally consistent with those of Exps I and II. (24 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Two group motivation loss effects demonstrated in previous research, the social-loafing effect and the free-rider effect, are shown to follow from social dilemma theories. An experiment with 75 undergraduates was performed to empirically demonstrate a 3rd motivation loss effect, termed the "sucker" effect. It was hypothesized that group members would reduce their efforts if they had a capable partner who free-rode on their efforts, that is, who was capable of contributing to the group but would not. This prediction was confirmed. The effect was particularly strong in males. Potential remedies for such motivation losses are discussed.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Generalized additive models (GAMs) have distinct advantages over generalized linear models as they allow investigators to make inferences about associations between outcomes and predictors without placing parametric restrictions on the associations. The variable of interest is often smoothed using a locally weighted regression (LOESS) and the optimal span (degree of smoothing) can be determined by minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A natural hypothesis when using GAMs is to test whether the smoothing term is necessary or if a simpler model would suffice. The statistic of interest is the difference in deviances between models including and excluding the smoothed term. As approximate chi-square tests of this hypothesis are known to be biased, permutation tests are a reasonable alternative. We compare the type I error rates of the chi-square test and of three permutation test methods using synthetic data generated under the null hypothesis. In each permutation method a distribution of differences in deviances is obtained from 999 permuted datasets and the null hypothesis is rejected if the observed statistic falls in the upper 5{\%} of the distribution. One test is a conditional permutation test using the optimal span size for the observed data; this span size is held constant for all permutations. This test is shown to have an inflated type I error rate. Alternatively, the span size can be fixed a priori such that the span selection technique is not reliant on the observed data. This test is shown to be unbiased; however, the choice of span size is not clear. A third method is an unconditional permutation test where the optimal span size is selected for observed and permuted datasets. This test is unbiased though computationally intensive.},

This article shows that there is a discernible relationship between election cycles and the behavior of democratic states in international conflicts. In the past 200 years, democratic states have tended to get into relatively more wars early in the election cycle and fewer wars late in the cycle. Interestingly, this result holds regardless of whether it was a democracy or a nondemocracy which initiated the war. The author argues, however, that this pattern at the international level is insufficient for drawing firm conclusions about the preferences of democratic states and societies at the domestic level. Finally, the author suggests that although election dynamics may mitigate against war entry in the short run, it is plausible that they have made war more likely or more severe in the long run.},

We propose a method of estimating the mean function non- parametrically under the assumption that it is smooth. We suggest a variant on the usual form of cross-validation for choosing the degree of smoothing to be employed. This method of cross-validation, which consists of deleting entire sample curves, has the advantage that it does not require that the covariance structure be known or estimated. In the estimation of the covariance structure, we are primarily concerned with models in which the first few eigenfunctions are smooth and the eigenvalues decay rapidly, so that the variability is predominantly of large scale. We propose smooth nonparametric estimates of the eigen- functions and a suitable method of cross-validation to determine the amount of smoothing. Our methods are applied to data on the gaits of a group of 5-year-old children.},

	abstract = {When energy is scarce or expensive, people can suffer material deprivation and economic hardship. When it is obtained in ways that fail to minimize environmental and political costs, these too can threaten human wellbeing in fundamental and pervasive ways. The energy problem today combines these syndromes: much of the world's population has too little energy to meet basic human needs; the monetary costs of energy are rising nearly everywhere; the environmental impacts of energy supply are growing and already dominant contributors to local, regional, and global environmental problems (including air pollution, water pollution, ocean pollution, and climate change); and the sociopolitical risks of energy supply (above all the danger of conflict over oil and the links between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons) are growing too. This predicament has many causes, but predominant among them are the nearly 20-fold increase in world energy use since 1850 and the cumulative depletion of the most convenient oil and gas deposits that this growth has entailed, resulting in increasing resort to costlier and/or environmentally more disruptive energy sources. The growth of world population in this period was responsible for 52{\%} of the energy growth, while growth in per capita energy use was responsible for 48{\%} (excluding causal connections between population and energy use per capita). In the United States in the same period, population growth accounted for 66{\%} of the 36-fold increase in energy use. In the late 1980s, population growth was still accounting for a third of energy growth both in the United States and worldwide. Coping with global energy problems will require greatly increased investment in improving the efficiency of energy enduse and in reducing the environmental impacts of contemporary energy technologies, and it will require financing a transition over the next several decades to a set of more sustainable (but probably also more expensive) energy sources. The difficulty of implementing these measures will be greatest by far in the developing countries, not least because of their high rates of population growth and the attendant extra pressures on economic and managerial resources. If efficiency improvements permit delivering the high standard of living to which the world aspires based on a per capita rate of energy use as low as 3 kilowatts—about a quarter of the current U.S. figure—then a world population stabilized at 10 billion people would be using energy at a rate of 30 terawatts, and a population of 14 billion would imply 42 terawatts (compare 13.2 terawatts in 1990). Delivering even the lower figure at tolerable monetary and environmental costs will be difficult; each additional billion people added to the world population will compound these difficulties and increase energy's costs, making everyone poorer.},

@article{Horowitz1992,
	abstract = {Manski (1985) has shown that the maximum score estimator of the coefficient vector of a binary response model is consistent under weak distributional assumptions. Cavanagh (1987) and Kim and Pollard (1989) have shown that N{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} times the centered maximum score estimator converges in distribution to the random variable that maximizes a certain Gaussian process. The properties of the limiting distribution are largely unknown, and the result of Cavanagh and Kim and Pollard cannot be used for inference in applications. This paper describes a modified maximum score estimator that is obtained by maximizing a smoothed version of Manski's score function. Under distributional assumptions that are somewhat stronger than Manski's but still very weak, the centered smoothed estimator is asymptotically normal with a convergence rate that is at least N{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2/5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and can be made arbitrarily close to N{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1/2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, depending on the strength of certain smoothness assumptions. The estimator's rate of convergence is the fastest possible under the assumptions that are made. The parameters of the limiting distribution can be estimated consistently from data, thereby making statistical inference based on the smoothed estimator possible with samples that are sufficiently large.},

Indeed, this belief has encouraged the view that presidents are apt to rattle the saber to divert attention from domestic problems. The rally effect is assessed by measuring the change in the president's popularity following all major uses of force by the United States from 1950 through 1984. Surprisingly, for these 102 cases, the mean change in the president's approval rating is 0{\%}, even among the members of his party. Even well-publicized uses of force during a crisis boost the president's standing only 2{\%}-3{\%} on average. Regression analyses confirm that the rallying effect of a use of force is greater in a crisis and when the action is prominently reported by the media. In addition, rallies are greater when the president enjoys bipartisan support, his initial popularity is low, and the country is not at war or fatigued by war.},

Method- ologists have long found it useful to separate inferential prob- lems into statistical and identification components. Studies of identification seek to characterize the conclusions that could be drawn if the researcher had available a sample of unlimited size. Studies of statistical inference seek to characterize the generally weaker conclusions that can be drawn given a sample of positive butfinite size. Statistical and identification problems limit in distinct ways the conclusions that may be drawn in empirical research. Statistical problems are most severe when the available sample is small. Identification problems are most severe when the researcher knows little about the population under study and the sampling process yields only weak data on the population. This chapter synthesizes some of my recent research and thinking on identification problems in the social sciences. Four problems are discussed: extrapolation of regres- sions, the selection problem, identification of endogenous so- cial effects, and identification of subjective phenomena. These problems arise regularly in social science research and are the source of many substantive disputes.},

Results suggest that insurance exerts considerable influence on corn farmers' chemical use decisions. Those purchasing insurance applied significantly more nitrogen per acre (19{\%}), spent more on pesticides (21{\%}), and treated more acreage with both herbicides and insecticides (7{\%} and 63{\%}) than did those not purchasing insurance. These results suggest that both fertilizer and pesticides may be risk-increasing inputs.},

Consistent asymptotic variance estimators are given to enable approximation of the asymptotic distribution. Asymptotic efficiency is another desirable property then considered. Throughout the chapter, the general results are also specialized to common econometric estimators (e.g. MLE and GMM), and in specific examples we work through the conditions for the various results in detail. The results are also extended to two-step estimators (with finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators (with nonparametric estimation of an infinite-dimensional parameter in the first step). Finally, the trinity of test statistics is considered within the quite general setting of GMM estimation, and numerous examples are given. {\textcopyright} 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

The paper uses this technique to study shocks to techno- logy and shocks to government spending financed by lump-sum or distortionary taxation.

Usually, however, such datasets have substantial sample size in the cross-section dimension (N), whereas T is often a single-digit number. Results on the asymptotic bias (N → ∞) in this situation have been published a decade ago, but, hence far, analytic small sample assessments of the actual bias have not been presented. Here we derive a formula for the bias of the Least-Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV) estimator which has a O(N-1 T- 3 2) approximation error. In a simulation study this is found to be remarkably accurate. Due to the small variance of the LSDV estimator, which is usually much smaller than the variance of consistent (Generalized) Method of Moments estimators, a very efficient procedure results when we remove the bias from the LSDV estimator. The simulations contain results for a particular operational corrected LSDV estimation procedure which in many situations proves to be (much) more efficient than various instrumental variable type estimators. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

	abstract = {We consider an econometric model based on a set of moment conditions which are indexed by both a finite-dimensional vector of interest, $\theta$, and an infinite-dimensional parameter, h, which in turn depends upon both $\theta$ and another infinite-dimensional parameter, $\tau$. The population moment conditions equal zero at $\theta$ = $\theta$0. Estimators of $\theta$0 are obtained by forming nonparametric estimates of h and $\tau$, substituting them into the sample analog of the moment conditions, and choosing that value of $\theta$ that makes the sample moments as 'close as possible' to zero. Using independence and smoothness assumptions the paper provides consistency, √n consistency, and asymptotic normality proofs for the resultant estimator. As an example, we consider Olley and Pakes' (1991) use of semiparametric techniques to control for both simultaneity and selection biases in estimating production functions. The example illustrates how semiparametric techniques an be used to overcome both computational problems and the need for strong functional form restrictions in obtaining estimates from structural models. It also illustrates the impacts of 1. (i) alternative estimators for the nonparametric components of the problem and 2. (ii) alternative estimators for the standard errors of the estimated $\theta$. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

However, the standard theory of consumer behaviour which forms the basis of their analyses is arguably ill-designed to deal with such issues. It is argued that there are some fundamental deficiencies with the conventional approach to consumer behaviour. Many of these arise from the reliance upon a particular conception (or construct) of the individual within mainstream theory, which is open to severe criticism from social theory/ philosophy. Some illustrations of these problems, which are encountered when attempting to explain changes in preferences, are discussed and the importance of alternative approaches is suggested. The implications for modelling changes in demand are indicated and it is suggested that agricultural economists should either limit the types of questions which they ask or give serious consideration to alternative approaches.},

Our empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incum bents. Firms' choices on whether to liquidate, and on input quantities should they continue, depended on their productivity. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different and more plausible estimates of production func tion coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures. Using our estimates we find increases in the rate of aggregate productivity growth after deregulation. Since we have plant-level data we can introduce indices which delve deeper into how this productivity growth occurred. These indices indicate that productivity increases were primarily a result of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.},

We make a case for interpreting these contributions as a “theoretical lower bound” on the value of the public good and estimate the lower bound. We also investigate whether we can use contingent donation data to estimate such lower bounds on values. We used a follow-up to the contingent donation question about the respondent's level of certainty with respect to her response to the contingent donation question. The results of this study suggest that use of the follow-up certainty question to differentiate respondents who would actually donate from those who would not is a promising approach to estimating a lower bound to Hicksian surplus measures.},

Within this framework this is the first book to discuss the principles of the nonparametric approach to the topics covered in a first year graduate course in econometrics, e.g. regression function, heteroskedasticity, simultaneous equations models, logit-probit and censored models. Nonparametric and semiparametric methods potentially offer considerable reward to applied researchers, owing to the methods' ability to adapt to many unknown features of the data. Professors Pagan and Ullah provide intuitive explanations of difficult concepts, heuristic developments of theory, and empirical examples emphasizing the usefulness of the modern nonparametric approach. The book should provide a new perspective on teaching and research in applied subjects in general and econometrics and statistics in particular.},

	abstract = {It is now quite common to have panels in which both T, the number of time series observations, and N, the number of groups, are quite large and of the same order of magnitude. The usual practice is either to estimate N separate regressions and calculate the coefficient means, which we call the mean group (MG) estimator, or to pool the data and assume that the slope coefficients and error variances are identical. In this article we propose an intermediate procedure, the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator, which constrains long-run coefficients to be identical but allows short-run coefficients and error variances to differ across groups. We consider both the case where the regressors are stationary and the case where they follow unit root processes, and for both cases derive the asymptotic distribution of the PMG estimators as T tends to infinity. We also provide two empirical applications: Aggregate consumption functions for 24 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economies over the period 1962–1993, and energy demand functions for 10 Asian developing economies over the period 1974–1990. {\textcopyright} 1999 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

The limit theory allows for both sequential limits, wherein T c-oo followed by n -* oo, and joint limits where T, n -c00 simultaneously; and the relationship between these multidimensional limits is explored. The panel structures considered allow for no time series cointegration, heterogeneous cointegration, homogeneous cointegration, and near-homogeneous cointegration. The paper explores the existence of long-run average relations between integrated panel vectors when there is no individual time series cointegration and when there is heteroge- neous cointegration. These relations are parameterized in terms of the matrix regression coefficient of the long-run average covariance matrix. In the case of homogeneous and near homogeneous cointegrating panels, a panel fully modified regression estimator is developed and studied. The limit theory enables us to test hypotheses about the long run average parameters both within and between subgroups of the full population.},

@article{Agrawal1999,
	abstract = {The poor conservation outcomes that followed decades of intrusive resource management strategies and planned development have forced policy makers and scholars to reconsider the role of community in resource use and conservation. In a break from previous work on development which considered communities a hindrance to progressive social change, current writings champion the role of community in bringing about decentralization, meaningful participation, and conservation. But despite its recent popularity, the concept of community is rarely defined or carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and management. We seek to redress this omission by investigating 'community' in work concerning resource conservation and management. We explore the conceptual origins of the community, and the ways the term has been deployed in writings on resource use. We then analyze those aspects of community most important to advocates for community's role in resource management - community as a small spatial unit, as a homogeneous social structure, and as shared norms - and indicate the weaknesses of these approaches. Finally, we suggest a more political approach: community must be examined in the context of development and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and actors within communities, on how these actors influence decision-making, and on the internal and external institutions that shape the decision-making process. A focus on institutions rather than 'community' is likely to be more fruitful for those interested in community-based natural resource management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and body mass index (BMI) is well documented, broad population studies focusing on the association between BMI and various forms of disadvantage such as unemployment, low income or social isolation are rare. METHODS: A nationwide, representative sample of 25-64-year-old Finnish subjects (n = 6016) was classified according to their BMI into four groups: 'thin' (BMI {\textless} 20), 'normal' (BMI 20-24.9), 'overweight' (BMI 25-29.9) and 'obese' (BMI {\textgreater} or = 30). Multivariable analyses using logistic regression were conducted with this BMI-grouping as an independent variable to predict social and economic disadvantage, controlling simultaneously for age, educational attainment, region of residence, and limiting long-standing illness. RESULTS: In women, overweight was associated with current unemployment and obesity with long-term unemployment as well as absence of close friends outside the family circle. Both overweight and obesity were associated with low individual earnings. Obese women were also most likely to have low household disposable and individual incomes; a similar pattern was seen among thin women. A small subgroup of thin men were socially and economically disadvantaged with all our indicators whereas excess body weight was not problematic for men. CONCLUSIONS: Deviant body weight is associated with social and economic disadvantage in a gender-specific and partly curvilinear way. In particular, obese women face multiple social and economic disadvantage.},

Mandatory tools have been much used in the Mediterranean context, and now represent the core of forest policies. More recently financial or economic tools, mainly based on payments, and internalisation of externalities, have emerged. Also market options are now envisaged and applied as shown by recent surveys. Policy effectiveness is improved by the use of a combined set of tools. The most appropriate mix has not yet been formalised and this represents a policy challenge.},

In this paper, we report on the procedures to factor in the contributions of individual group members engaged in an integrated group project using peer assessment procedures. Our findings demonstrate that the method we used resulted in a substantially wider spread of marks being given to individual students. Almost every student was awarded a numerical score which was higher or lower than a simple group project mark would have been. When these numerical scores were converted into the final letter grades, approximately one-third of the students received a grade for the group project that was different from the grade that they would have received if the same grade had been awarded to all group members. Based on these preliminary {\textregistered} ndings we conclude that peer assessment can be usefully and meaningfully employed to factor individual contributions into the grades awarded to students engaged in collaborative group work.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study investigated experimentally whether acute stress alters food choice during a meal. The study was designed to test claims of selective effects of stress on appetite for specific sensory and nutritional categories of food and interactions with eating attitudes.
	Methods: Sixty-eight healthy men and women volunteered for a study on “the effects of hunger on physiology, performance, and mood.” Eating attitudes and food preferences were measured on entry to the study. The stressed group prepared a 4-minute speech, expecting it to be filmed and assessed after a midday meal, although in fact speeches were not performed. The ad libitum meal included sweet, salty, or bland high- and low-fat foods. The control group listened to a passage of neutral text before eating the meal. Blood pressure, heart rate, mood, and hunger were measured at baseline and after the 10-minute preparatory period, when appetite for 34 foods and food intake were recorded.
	Results: Increases in blood pressure and changes in mood confirmed the effectiveness of the stressor. Stress did not alter overall intake, nor intake of, or appetite for the six food categories. However, stressed emotional eaters ate more sweet high-fat foods and a more energy-dense meal than unstressed and nonemotional eaters. Dietary restraint did not significantly affect appetitive responses to stress.
	Conclusions: Increased eating of sweet fatty foods by emotional eaters during stress, found here in a laboratory setting, may underlie the previously reported finding that dietary restraint or female gender predicts stress-induced eating. Stress may compromise the health of susceptible individuals through deleterious stress-related changes in food choice.},

Growing pressures on the resource base of rural communities are making it increasingly difficult to develop appropriate independent tree management practices not requiring external support. Such support needs to be accurately matched to the particular needs and possibilities of each case. Three community forestry strategies are reviewed-communal forestry, farm forestry for the household, and farm forestry for the market.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a semiparametric model for large-dimension vector time series whose elements correspond to economic agents. Dependence between agents' variables is characterized using a spatial model. Functions of agents' economic distances provide restrictions that enable estimation of a vector autoregressive specification. We present sufficient conditions for our model to generate stationary, $\beta$-mixing series with finite higher-order moments. We estimate the model using a simple two-step sieve least-squares procedure, where the sieve estimators are constructed to preserve shape restrictions on the functions of economic distance, e.g., positive definiteness of a covariance function. We provide rates of convergence for the sieve estimators, √T limiting distributions for the model's finite-dimensional parameters, and a bootstrap method for inference. In an illustrative application, we use this model to characterize how the comovement in output growth across US industrial sectors depends on the similarity of sectors' technologies. We also present a small Monte Carlo evaluation of our estimators. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Working within a Generational Accounting framework, we find that maintaining the new legal setting could leave future generations with liabilities as high as 176 percent of base year GDP. As the recent reform measures have been insufficient to achieve the sustainability of the current pension system, we also analyse the impact of alternative reform strategies. Within the current pay-as-you-go setting, a further improvement to tax-benefit linkage in line with the original spirit of the Toledo Agreement is shown to yield and intergenerationally more balanced outcome, than an increase in the retirement age or an expansion of public subsidies financed through indirect taxes. Finally, we examine the generational impact of a move toward a partially funded pension system which might restore the intergenerational balance.},

Therefore, we examined these associations in a nationwide, representative sample of 25- to 64-y-old Finnish men and women (n = 6506). The respondents were classified by their body mass index (BMI) into four groups: thin, normal, overweight and obese. Economic disadvantage was assessed by three indicators including low household income, unemployment during past 5 y and long-term economic problems in childhood. Food insecurity was assessed by five separate items concerning economic fears and experiences related to sufficient supply of food during the past 12 mo, and a combined scale in which those with affirmative responses to four to five items were classified as hungry. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted using both the BMI grouping and indicators of economic disadvantage as independent variables to predict food insecurity, controlling simultaneously for age, educational attainment and sex. The results showed that low household income, recent unemployment and economic problems in childhood were all predictors of food insecurity. Thin people were most likely to be hungry and showed most food insecurity in five separate items. In addition, obese people reported more buying cheaper food due to economic problems and fears or experiences of running out of money to buy food than did normal weight subjects. In conclusion, both past and present economic disadvantage is associated with various aspects of food insecurity. The association between food insecurity and BMI is curvilinear.},

Moreover, the decrease occurring during bad economic times is concentrated among heavy consumers, with light drinking actually rising. We also find no evidence that the decline in overall alcohol use masks a rise for persons becoming unemployed during contractions. These results suggest that any stress-induced increases in drinking during bad economic times are more than offset by declines resulting from changes in economic factors such as lower incomes.},

This paper also develops an asymptotic theory for tests of coefficient homogeneity under cross section dependence, and proposes a modified Hausman test to test for the presence of homogeneous unit roots. An orthogonalization procedure, based on iterated method of moments estimation, is developed to remove cross section dependence and permit the use of conventional and meta unit root tests with panel data.

	abstract = {Kiyotaki and Moore (J. Polit. Economy 105 (1997) 211) have offered a theory for how common shocks to credit-constrained firms are amplified through changes in collateral values and transmitted as fluctuations in output. I clarify and extend their model by showing that their collateral amplification mechanism is not robust to the introduction of markets that allow these firms to hedge against common shocks. A theory of incomplete hedging is proposed in which the supply of hedging available in the economy is constrained by the aggregate value of collateral. I illustrate how the constraint reinstates amplification effects and discuss empirical implications of this new mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes unit root tests for dynamic heterogeneous panels based on the mean of individual unit root statistics. In particular it proposes a standardized t-bar test statistic based on the (augmented) Dickey-Fuller statistics averaged across the groups. Under a general setting this statistic is shown to converge in probability to a standard normal variate sequentially with T (the time series dimension) → ∞, followed by N (the cross sectional dimension) → ∞. A diagonal convergence result with T and N → ∞ while N/T → k, k being a finite non-negative constant, is also conjectured. In the special case where errors in individual Dickey-Fuller (DF) regressions are serially uncorrelated a modified version of the standardized t-bar statistic is shown to be distributed as standard normal as N → ∞ for a fixed T, so long as T {\textgreater} 5 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and T {\textgreater} 6 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and linear time trends. An exact fixed N and T test is also developed using the simple average of the DF statistics. Monte Carlo results show that if a large enough lag order is selected for the underlying ADF regressions, then the small sample performances of the t-bar test is reasonably satisfactory and generally better than the test proposed by Levin and Lin (Unpublished manuscript, University of California, San Diego, 1993). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

It contains estimation error of the kind most likely to perturb a mean-variance optimizer. In its place, we suggest using the matrix obtained from the sample covariance matrix through a transformation called shrinkage. This tends to pull the most extreme coefficients towards more central values, thereby systematically reducing estimation error where it matters most. Statistically, the challenge is to know the optimal shrinkage intensity, and we give the formula for that. Without changing any other step in the portfolio optimization process, we show on actual stock market data that shrinkage reduces tracking error relative to a benchmark index, and substantially increases the realized information ratio of the active portfolio manager.},

However, a common belief exists that risk can be effectively pooled only when random loss is independent. Therefore crop insurance markets cannot survive without government subsidy because crop yields are not independent among growers. In this article, we take a spatial statistics approach to examine the effectiveness of risk pooling for crop insurance under correlation. We develop a method for evaluating the effectiveness of risk pooling under correlation and apply the method to three major crops in the United States: wheat, soybeans, and corn. The empirical study shows that yields for the three crops present zero or negative correlation when two counties are far apart, which complies with a weaker condition than independence, finite-range positive dependency. The results show that effective risk pooling is possible and reveal a high possibility of a private crop insurance market in the United States.},

Consistent with hypotheses, the findings showed different comfort food preferences across gender and across age. Males preferred warm, hearty, meal-related comfort foods (such as steak, casseroles, and soup), while females instead preferred comfort foods that were more snack related (such as chocolate and ice cream). In addition, younger people preferred more snack-related comfort foods compared to those over 55 years of age. Associations with guilty feelings underscored how these different preferences between males and females may extend to areas of application.},

For large-dimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator - the sample covariance matrix - is typically not well-conditioned and may not even be invertible. This paper introduces an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and the number of variables go to infinity together. Extensive Monte Carlo confirm that the asymptotic results tend to hold well in finite sample. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We characterize the optimal combination weights for the most commonly used alternatives to mean squared error loss and demonstrate how the degree of asymmetry in the loss function and skews in the underlying forecast error distribution can significantly change the optimal combination weights.

In an unrestricted VAR(p) model in k endogenous variables covering N countries, the number of unknown parameters will be unfeasibly large. We deal with this issue by first estimating individual country/region specific vector error-correcting models, where the domestic variables are related to corresponding foreign variables constructed to match the relevant international trade pattern. The country models are then combined to generate forecasts for all the variables in the world economy simultaneously. We estimate the model using quarterly data from 1979Q1 to 1999Q1, and investigate the time profile of the transmission of shocks of one variable to the rest of the world to show the degree of regional interdependencies.},

Generalized method of moments (GMM) and quasi maximum likelihood (QML) estimators are obtained and compared in terms of their asymptotic and finite-sample properties. It is shown that the asymptotic variances of the GMM estimators that are based on levels in addition to first differences of the model variables depend on the variance of the individual effects, whereas by construction the fixed effects QML estimator is not subject to this problem. Monte Carlo evidence is provided showing that the fixed effects QML estimator tends to outperform the various GMM estimators in finite sample under both normal and nonnormal errors. The paper also shows how the fixed effects QML estimator can be successfully used for unit root and cointegration tests in short panels. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

The drop in tobacco use occurs disproportionately among heavy smokers, the fall in body weight among the severely obese and the increase in exercise among those who were completely inactive. Declining work hours may provide one reason why behaviors become healthier, possibly by increasing the non-market time available for lifestyle investments. Conversely, there is little evidence of an important role for income reductions.

	abstract = {It is well known that standard asymptotic theory is not applicable or is very unreliable in models with identification problems or weak instruments. One possible way out consists of using a variant of the Anderson-Rubin ((1949), AR) procedure. The latter allows one to build exact tests and confidence sets only for the full vector of the coefficients of the endogenous explanatory variables in a structural equation, but not for individual coefficients. This problem may in principle be overcome by using projection methods (Dufour (1997), Dufour and Jasiak (2001)). At first sight, however, this technique requires the application of costly numerical algorithms. In this paper, we give a general necessary and sufficient condition that allows one to check whether an AR-type confidence set is bounded. Furthermore, we provide an analytic solution to the problem of building projection-based confidence sets from AR-type confidence sets. The latter involves the geometric properties of "quadrics" and can be viewed as an extension of usual confidence intervals and ellipsoids. Only least squares techniques are needed to build the confidence intervals.},

When returns are non-normal, it is often simply impossible to specify the multivariate distribution relating two or more return series. In this context, we propose a new methodology based on copula functions, which consists in estimating first the univariate distributions and then the joining distribution. In such a context, the dependency parameter can easily be rendered conditional and time varying. We apply this methodology to the daily returns of four major stock markets. Our results suggest that conditional dependency depends on past realizations for European market pairs only. For these markets, dependency is found to be more widely affected when returns move in the same direction than when they move in opposite directions. Modeling the dynamics of the dependency parameter also suggests that dependency is higher and more persistent between European stock markets. ?? 2006.},

The main finding is that total mortality and deaths from several common causes rise when labor markets strengthen. For instance, controlling for year effects, location fixed-effects (FE), country-specific time trends and demographic characteristics, a 1{\%} point decrease in the national unemployment rate is associated with growth of 0.4{\%} in total mortality and the following increases in cause-specific mortality: 0.4{\%} for cardiovascular disease, 1.1{\%} for influenza/pneumonia, 1.8{\%} for liver disease, 2.1{\%} for motor vehicle deaths, and 0.8{\%} for other accidents. These effects are particularly pronounced for countries with weak social insurance systems, as proxied by public social expenditure as a share of GDP.

Model selection is a commonly used method to find such models, but usually involves a computationally heavy combinatorial search. Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is now being used as a computationally feasible alternative to model selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso for model selection purposes. In this paper, we prove that a single condition, which we call the Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and sufficient for Lasso to select the true model both in the classical fixed p setting and in the large p setting as the sample size n gets large. Based on these results, sufficient conditions that are verifiable in practice are given to relate to previous works and help applications of Lasso for feature selection and sparse representation. This Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on the covariance of the predictor variables, states that Lasso selects the true model consistently if and (almost) only if the predictors that are not in the true model are "irrepresentable" (in a sense to be clarified) by predictors that are in the true model. Furthermore, simulations are carried out to provide insights and understanding of this result.},

In this chapter we analyze theoretically the factors that determine the advantages from combining forecasts (for example, the degree of correlation between forecast errors and the relative size of the individual models' forecast error variances). Although the reasons for the success of simple combination schemes are poorly understood, we discuss several possibilities related to model misspecification, instability (non-stationarities) and estimation error in situations where the number of models is large relative to the available sample size. We discuss the role of combinations under asymmetric loss and consider combinations of point, interval and probability forecasts. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The level of expected deficit for the pay-as-you-go state pension fund seems to be most worrying. Financing the pension system with value-added tax revenues, as an extreme case, could result in more sustainable public finances, because gross domestic product and welfare levels ought to increase; however this might be infeasible to implement politically, given that generations of voters would have their welfare decreased. In addition, the present pension system is opaque and tremendously complicated and primarily, should be made more comprehensible to the public.},

Existing model average methods are based on exponential Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) weights. In distinction, this paper proposes selecting the weights by minimizing a Mallows criterion, the latter an estimate of the average squared error from the model average fit. We show that our new Mallows model average (MMA) estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible squared error in a class of discrete model average estimators. In a simulation experiment we show that the MMA estimator compares favorably with those based on AIC and BIC weights. The proof of the main result is an application of the work of Li (1987). {\textcopyright} The Econometric Society 2007.},

	abstract = {Partially linear models (PLM) are regression models in which the response depends on some covariates linearly but on other covariates nonparametrically. PLMs generalize standard linear regression techniques and are special cases of additive models. This chapter covers the basic results and explains how PLMs are applied in the biometric practice. More specifically, we are mainly concerned with least squares estimators of the linear parameter while the nonparametric part is estimated by e.g. kernel regression, spline approximation, piecewise polynomial and local polynomial techniques. When the model is heteroscedastic, the variance functions are approximated by weighted least squares estimators. Numerous examples illustrate the implementation in practice. PLMs are defined by Y = X-{\`{A}} + g(T) + -{\~{A}}, (5.1) where X and T are d-dimensional and scalar regressors, -{\`{A}} is a vector of unknown parameters, g(-E) an unknown smooth function and -{\~{A}} an error term with mean zero conditional on X and T. The PLM is a special form of the additive regression models Hastie and Tibshrani (1990); Stone (1985), which allows easier interpretation of the effect of each variables and may be preferable to a completely nonparametric regression since the well-known reason -gcurse of dimensionality-h. On the other hand, PLMs are more flexible than the standard linear models since they combine both parametric and nonparametric components. Several methods have been proposed to estimate PLMs. Suppose there are n observations {\{}Xi, Ti, Yi{\}}n i=1. Engle, Granger, Rice and Weiss (1986), Heck88 5 Partially Linear Models man (1986) and Rice (1986) used spline smoothing and defined estimators of -{\`{A}} and g as the solution of argmin -{\`{A}},g 1 n n i=1 {\{}Yi. Xi-{\`{A}}. g(Ti){\}}2 + -{\'{E}} {\{}g(u){\}}2du. (5.2) Speckman (1988) estimated the nonparametric component by W-{\'{A}}, where W is a (n -{\~{}} q).matrix of full rank and -{\'{A}} is an additional parameter. A PLM may be rewritten in a matrix form Y = X-{\`{A}} +W-{\'{A}} + -{\~{A}}. (5.3) The estimator of -{\`{A}} based on (5.3) is-{\`{A}}S = {\{}X(I. PW)X{\}}.1{\{}X(I. PW)Y {\}}, (5.4) where PW = W(WW).1W is a projection matrix and I is a d.order identity matrix. Green, Jennison and Seheult (1985) proposed another class of estimates-{\`{A}}GJS = {\{}X(I.Wh)X){\}}.1{\{}X(I.Wh)Y){\}} by replacing W in (5.4) by another smoother operator Wh. Chen (1988) proposed a piecewise polynomial to approximate nonparametric function and then derived the least squares estimator which is the same form as (5.4). Recently H-Nardle, Liang and Gao (2000) have systematically summarized the different approaches to PLM estimation. No matter which regression method is used for the nonparametric part, the forms of the estimators of -{\`{A}} may always be written as {\{}X(I.W)X{\}}.1{\{}X(I.W)Y {\}}, where W is a projection operation. The estimators are asymptotically normal under appropriate assumptions. The next section will be concerned with several nonparametric fit methods for g(t) because of their popularity, beauty and importance in nonparametric statistics. In Section 5.4, the Framingham heart study data are investigated for illustrating the theory and the proposed statistical techniques. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) network is a research programme established in 1992 to collect interdisciplinary information about forest sustainability and governance. IFRI is unique in terms of the large number of small-scale sites monitored (more than 350 communities and 9000 forest plots) for more than a decade, under the guidance of strong central leadership, a well defined research framework, relative autonomy of network members, and a strong inward focus. These features have enabled IFRI to have particular impacts on new knowledge, policy and local communities, and capacity building. Lessons about how to further strengthen, extend and sustain these impacts include developing more robust agreement about measures of forest sustainability, building network members' capacities to conduct comparative analysis, ensuring the database meets the needs of multiple users and expanding the membership and outreach of the network.},

We find, first, that networks can lead to specialization in public good provision. In every social network there is an equilibrium where some individuals contribute and others free ride. In many networks, this extreme is the only outcome. Second, specialization can benefit society as a whole. This outcome arises when contributors are linked, collectively, to many agents. Finally, a new link increases access to public goods, but reduces individual incentives to contribute. Hence, overall welfare can be higher when there are holes in a network. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Often researchers find parametric models restrictive and sensitive to deviations from the parametric specifications; semi-nonparametric models are more flexible and robust, but lead to other complications such as introducing infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that may not be compact and the optimization problem may no longer be well-posed. The method of sieves provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense in the original space and the resulting optimization problem becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without) endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate prior information and constraints, often derived from economic theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity, multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in semi-nonparametric models, typically with optimal convergence rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of semi-nonparametric econometric models via the method of sieves. We present some general results on the large sample properties of the sieve estimates, including consistency of the sieve extremum estimates, convergence rates of the sieve M-estimates, pointwise normality of series estimates of regression functions, root-n asymptotic normality and efficiency of sieve estimates of smooth functionals of infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the general results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

The proposed test, denoted by over($\Delta$, ̃), exploits the cross section dispersion of individual slopes weighted by their relative precision. In the case of models with strictly exogenous regressors, but with non-normally distributed errors, the test is shown to have a standard normal distribution as (N, T)over(→, j) ∞ such that sqrt(N) / T2 → 0. When the errors are normally distributed, a mean-variance bias adjusted version of the test is shown to be normally distributed irrespective of the relative expansion rates of N and T. The test is also applied to stationary dynamic models, and shown to be valid asymptotically so long as N / T → $\kappa$, as (N, T) over(→, j) ∞, where 0 ≤ $\kappa$ {\textless} ∞. Using Monte Carlo experiments, it is shown that the test has the correct size and satisfactory power in panels with strictly exogenous regressors for various combinations of N and T. Similar results are also obtained for dynamic panels, but only if the autoregressive coefficient is not too close to unity and so long as T ≥ N. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The literature on model comparison often requires the assumption that the true conditional distribution corresponds to that of one of the competing models. This strong assumption has been extended by the notion of encompassing and in likelihood based model comparisons. This paper takes the latter approach and develops tests for the comparison of competing nonlinear dynamic models, focusing on the nested and overlaping cases. The null hypothesis is that the models are equally close to the data generating process (DGP), according to a certain measure of closeness. The alternative is that one model is closer to the DGP. The models can be correctly specified or not. Their parameters can be estimated by a variety of methods, including (pseudo) maximum likelihood and ordinary least squares. The tests are symmetric and directional. Their asymptotic distribution under the null is either normal or a weighted sum of chi-squared distributions, depending on the nesting characteristics of the competing models. The comparison of nested AR models, and of nested ARMA models with GARCH errors and exogenous forcing variables (ARMAX-GARCH) are discussed as examples.},

	abstract = {High dimensionality causes problems in various areas of statistics. A particular situation that rarely has been considered is the testing of hypotheses about multivariate regression models in which the dimension of the multivariate response is large. In this article a ridge regularization approach is proposed in which either the covariance or the correlation matrix is regularized to ensure nonsingularity irrespective of the dimensionality of the data. It is shown that the proposed approach can be derived through a penalized likelihood approach, which suggests cross-validation of the likelihood function as a natural approach for estimation of the ridge parameter. Useful properties of this likelihood estimator are derived, discussed, and demonstrated by simulation. For a class of test statistics commonly used in multivariate analysis, the proposed regularization approach is compared with some obvious alternative regularization approaches using generalized inverse and data reduction through principal compone...},

Instead, in this paper we provide a model that rationalizes these facts as an equilibrium outcome of two observed forces: a) potential growth differentials among different regions of the world and, b) heterogeneity in these regions' capacity to generate financial assets from real investments. In extensions of the basic model, we also generate exchange rate and FDI excess returns which are broadly consistent with the recent trends in these variables. Unlike the conventional wisdom, in the absence of a large change in (a) or (b), our model does not augur any catastrophic event. More generally, the framework is flexible enough to shed light on a range of scenarios in a global equilibrium environment.},

We examine covariance matrix estimation in the asymptotic framework that the dimensionality p tends to ∞ as the sample size n increases. Motivated by the Arbitrage Pricing Theory in finance, a multi-factor model is employed to reduce dimensionality and to estimate the covariance matrix. The factors are observable and the number of factors K is allowed to grow with p. We investigate the impact of p and K on the performance of the model-based covariance matrix estimator. Under mild assumptions, we have established convergence rates and asymptotic normality of the model-based estimator. Its performance is compared with that of the sample covariance matrix. We identify situations under which the factor approach increases performance substantially or marginally. The impacts of covariance matrix estimation on optimal portfolio allocation and portfolio risk assessment are studied. The asymptotic results are supported by a thorough simulation study. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Logistic regression models were used to analyze whether a period of unemployment in 2000 resulted in an increase in smoking and drinking or fluctuations in body weight among 2001 re-employed individuals in comparison with 1999 baseline levels.

Eighty-three Japanese freshmen worked in groups to create TV commercials. They then completed two types of peer assessment. Results indicated an overall similarity between peer and instructor assessments, along with some notable differences in item difficulties. Most group members succeeded in differentiating the degree of each member's contribution to the group project. Strong support, however, was not found for the assumption that groups with high cooperators produced quality group presentations. Although these results are encouraging for using peer assessment for EFL group presentations, some caution is advised.},

The term "time inconsistency" is usually used to refer to cases in which a larger-later outcome is preferred over a smaller-sooner one when both are delayed by some time, but then with the passage of time a preference switches to the smaller-sooner outcome. The current paper presents four empirical studies showing that time inconsistency in the other direction is also possible: A person may prefer the smaller-sooner outcome when both options are in the future, but decide to wait for the larger-later one when the smaller option becomes immediately available. We find that such "reverse time inconsistency" is more likely to be observed when the delays to and between the two outcomes are short (up to a week). We propose that reverse time inconsistency may be associated with a reversed-S shape discount function, and provide evidence that such a discount function captures part of the variation in intertemporal preferences.},

Our key element is to employ the (feasible) bias-corrected average forecast. Using panel-data sequential asymptotics we show that it is potentially superior to other techniques in several contexts. In particular, it is asymptotically equivalent to the conditional expectation, i.e., has an optimal limiting mean-squared error. We also develop a zero-mean test for the average bias and discuss the forecast-combination puzzle in small and large samples. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the feasible bias-corrected average forecast in finite samples. An empirical exercise, based upon data from a well known survey is also presented. Overall, these results show promise for the feasible bias-corrected average forecast. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the impact of error cross-sectional dependence (modelled as a factor structure) on a number of widely used IV and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators in the context of a linear dynamic panel data model. It is shown that, under such circumstances, the standard moment conditions used by these estimators are invalid - a result that holds for any lag length of the instruments used. Transforming the data in terms of deviations from time-specific averages helps to reduce the asymptotic bias of the estimators, unless the factor loadings have mean zero. The finite sample behaviour of IV and GMM estimators is investigated by means of Monte Carlo experiments. The results suggest that the bias of these estimators can be severe to the extent that the standard fixed effects estimator is not generally inferior anymore in terms of root median square error. Time-specific demeaning alleviates the problem, although the effectiveness of this transformation decreases when the variance of the factor loadings is large. {\textcopyright} The Author(s).

In addition, we show that generalized thresholding has the "sparsistency" property, meaning it estimates true zeros a, zeros with probability tending to 1, and, under an additional mild condition, is sign consistent for nonzero elements.

We find that the link between leverage and stock returns is more complex than static textbook examples suggest, and depends on the investment opportunities available to the firm. In the presence of financial market imperfections, leverage and investment are generally correlated so that highly levered firms are also mature firms with relatively more (safe) book assets and fewer (risky) growth opportunities. A quantitative version of our model matches several stylized facts about leverage and returns.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear panel data models arise naturally in economic applications, yet their analysis is challenging. Here we provide a progress report on some recent advances in the area. We start by reviewing the properties of random-effects likelihood approaches. We emphasize a link with Bayesian computation and Markov chain Monte Carlo, which provides a convenient approach to estimation and inference. The relaxation of parametric assumptions on the distribution of individual effects raises serious identification problems. In discrete choice models, common parameters and average marginal effects are generally set identified. The availability of continuous outcomes, however, provides opportunities for point identification. We end by reviewing recent progress on non-fixed-T approaches. In panel applications in which the time dimension is not negligible relative to the size of the cross section, it makes sense to view the estimation problem as a time-series finite-sample bias. Several perspectives to bias reduction are now available. We review their properties, with a special emphasis on random-effects methods.},

	abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We suggest that the ambiguous findings in the extant literature may be due in part to unobserved heterogeneity in response and in part due to an overly broad measure of job loss that is partially endogenous (e.g., layoffs). We improve upon this literature using: exogenously determined business closings, a sophisticated estimation approach (finite mixture models) to deal with complex heterogeneity, and national, longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study. For both alcohol consumption and BMI, we find evidence that individuals who are more likely to respond to job loss by increasing unhealthy behaviors are already in the problematic range for these behaviors before losing their jobs. These results suggest the health effects of job loss could be concentrated among " at risk" individuals and could lead to negative outcomes for the individuals, their families, and society at large. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Three cultural and ideological forces have continued to shape the gender discourse in Arab Muslim-majority societies. They are: “Islamic” teaching and local traditions concerning women's roles in a given society; Western, European colonial perception of women's rights; and finally national gender-related policy reforms. This paper examines the past and present status of women and gender-educational inequality in the Arab world with particular reference to Egypt and Tunisia, prior to and post colonialism. Special attention is given to colonial legacy and its influence on gender and education; to current gender practices in the social sphere with a focus on women's modesty (hijab); to international policies and national responses with regard to women's rights and finally to female participation in pre-university and higher education. These issues incorporate a discussion of cultural and religious constraints. The paper demonstrates similarities and differences between Egypt's and Tunisia's reform policies towards gender parity. It highlights the confrontation of conservative versus liberal ideologies that occurred in each country with the implementation of its gender-related reform policy.},

	abstract = {Many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of best-selling products. The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of niche products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of sales. This paper investigates the Internet's “long tail” phenomenon. By analyzing data collected from a multichannel retailer, it provides empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution when compared with traditional channels. Previous explanations for this result have focused on differences in product availability between channels. However, we demonstrate that the result survives even when the Internet and traditional channels share exactly the same product availability and prices. Instead, we find that consumers' usage of Internet search and discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, are associated with an increase the share of niche products. We conclude that the Internet's long tail is not solely due to the increase in product selection but may also partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet. If the relationships we uncover persist, the underlying trends in technology portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales.},

We estimate the sample spectral density and its Hilbert transform directly by smoothing the sample eigenvalues with a variable-bandwidth kernel. Relative to numerically inverting the so-called QuEST function, the main advantages of direct kernel estimation are: (1) it is much easier to comprehend because it is analogous to kernel density estimation; (2) it is only twenty lines of code in Matlab — as opposed to thousands — which makes it more verifiable and customizable; (3) it is 200 times faster without significant loss of accuracy; and (4) it can handle matrices of a dimension larger by a factor of ten. Even for dimension 10, 000, the code runs in less than two minutes on a desktop computer; this makes the power of nonlinear shrinkage as accessible to applied statisticians as the one of linear shrinkage.},

	abstract = {This paper considers GMM based estimation and testing procedures for two versions of the AR(1) model with Fixed Effects, henceforth abbreviated as ARFE(1): the conditional ARFE(1) model, and the inclusive ARFE(1) model, which contains the stationary ARFE(1) models and the ARFE(1) model with a unit root. First, the paper presents a two-step Optimal Linear GMM (OLGMM) estimator for the inclusive model, which is asymptotically equivalent to the optimal nonlinear GMM estimator of Ahn and Schmidt (1997). Then the paper examines the properties of the GMM estimators for both versions of the model when the data are persistent. Among other things, we find that the OLGMM estimator is superefficient in the unit root case. Furthermore, under stationarity the covariances of the instruments of the Arellano-Bond estimator and the first differences of the dependent variable are not weak. We also derive new approximations to the finite sample distributions of the Arellano-Bond estimator (for both versions of the model), the Arellano-Bover estimator, and the System estimator. We employ local-to-zero asymptotics (cf Staiger and Stock (1997)) for the Arellano-Bond estimator for the conditional model, because its instruments are weak in this context, and we employ local-to-unity asymptotics, which is developed in this paper, for the estimators for the stationary model. The new approximations agree well with the Monte Carlo evidence in terms of bias and variance. Finally, various GMM based unit root tests against stationary and conditional alternatives are proposed.},

	abstract = {As economic expansions raise employment and wages, associated shifts in income and time constraints would be expected to also impact individuals' health. This study utilizes information from the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1990-2009) to explore the relationship between the state unemployment rate and the consumption of various healthy and unhealthy foods in the United States. Estimates, based on fixed effects methodologies, indicate that unemployment is associated with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables and increased consumption of "unhealthy" foods such as snacks and fast food. Heterogeneous responses are also identified through detailed sample stratifications and by isolating the effect for those predicted to be at highest risk of unemployment based on their socioeconomic characteristics. Among individuals predicted to be at highest risk of being unemployed, a one percentage point increase in the resident state's unemployment rate is associated with a 3-6{\%} reduction in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The impact is somewhat higher among younger, low-educated, and married adults. Supplementary analyses also explore specific mediating pathways, and point to reduced family income and adverse mental health as significant channels underlying the procyclical nature of healthy food consumption. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Dethier2012,
	abstract = {After 20 years of neglect by international donors, agriculture is now again in the headlines because high food prices are increasing food insecurity and poverty. In the coming years, it will be essential to increase food productivity and production in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and with smallholders. This, however, requires finding viable solutions to a number of complex technical, institutional, and policy issues, including land markets, research on seeds and inputs, agricultural extension, credit, rural infrastructure, connection to markets, rural non-farm employment, trade policy and food price stabilization. This paper reviews what the economic literature has to say on these topics. It discusses in turn the role played by agriculture in the development process and the interactions between agriculture and other economic sectors, the determinants of the Green Revolution and the foundations of agricultural growth, issues of income diversification by farmers, approaches to rural development, and issues of international trade policy and food security, which have been at the root of the crisis in agricultural commodity volatility in recent years.},

@article{Graham2012,
	abstract = {In this paper we study identification and estimation of a correlated random coefficients (CRC) panel data model. The outcome of interest varies linearly with a vector of endogenous regressors. The coefficients on these regressors are heterogenous across units and may covary with them. We consider the average partial effect (APE) of a small change in the regressor vector on the outcome (cf. Chamberlain (1984), Wooldridge (2005a)). Chamberlain (1992) calculated the semiparametric efficiency bound for the APE in our model and proposed a √ N-consistent estimator. Nonsingularity of the APE's information bound, and hence the appropriateness of Chamberlain's (1992) estimator, requires (i) the time dimension of the panel ( T) to strictly exceed the number of random coefficients ( p) and (ii) strong conditions on the time series properties of the regressor vector. We demonstrate irregular identification of the APE when T = p and for more persistent regressor processes. Our approach exploits the different identifying content of the subpopulations of stayers-or units whose regressor values change little across periods-and movers-or units whose regressor values change substantially across periods. We propose a feasible estimator based on our identification result and characterize its large sample properties. While irregularity precludes our estimator from attaining parametric rates of convergence, its limiting distribution is normal and inference is straightforward to conduct. Standard software may be used to compute point estimates and standard errors. We use our methods to estimate the average elasticity of calorie consumption with respect to total outlay for a sample of poor Nicaraguan households. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

These neighbor countries are characterized by a changing insurance system from a public fund to private policies which are highly subsidized. Despite the stakes related to crop insurance-CAP reform, size of the market, implication of the governments -, few studies have been drawn on this topic. The literature in finance and in agricultural economics allows to build a two-stage empirical model which computes the elasticities of demand for crop insurance, and to define its key determinants. It appears that France and Italy present similar insurance systems in terms of products and of ability to indemnify. However, the farmers' sensitivity to insurance is most contrasted across the Alps. This leads to a discussion about the creation of an insurance market at the European scale.},

	abstract = {Although consumer spending typically declines in economic recessions, some observers have noted that recessions appear to increase women's spending on beauty products—the so-called lipstick effect. Using both historical spending data and rigorous experiments, the authors examine how and why economic recessions influence women's consumer behavior. Findings revealed that recessionary cues—whether naturally occurring or experimentally primed—decreased desire for most products (e.g., electronics, household items). However, these cues consistently increased women's desire for products that increase attractiveness to mates—the first experimental demonstration of the lipstick effect. Additional studies show that this effect is driven by women's desire to attract mates with resources and depends on the perceived mate attraction function served by these products. In addition to showing how and why economic recessions influence women's desire for beauty products, this research provides novel insights into women's mating psychology, consumer behavior, and the relationship between the two.

Through a meta-analysis of published case-studies, we compare land use/cover change data for these two broad types of forest management and assess their performance in maintaining forest cover. Case studies included 40 protected areas and 33 community managed forests from the peer reviewed literature. A statistical comparison of annual deforestation rates and a Qualitative Comparative Analysis were conducted. We found that as a whole, community managed forests presented lower and less variable annual deforestation rates than protected forests. We consider that a more resilient and robust forest conservation strategy should encompass a regional vision with different land use types in which social and economic needs of local inhabitants, as well as tenure rights and local capacities, are recognized. Further research for understanding institutional arrangements that derive from local governance in favor of tropical forest conservation is recommended. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

Many reasons exist for the apparent disconnects between installation costs, component prices, and system prices; most notable is the impact of fair market value considerations on system prices.

Our dynamic investment model extends the tradition of the knowledge capital model of Griliches (1979) that has remained a cornerstone of the productivity literature. Rather than constructing a stock of knowledge capital from a firm's observed R{\&}D expenditures, we consider productivity to be unobservable to the econometrician. Our approach accounts for uncertainty, non-linearity, and heterogeneity across firms in the link between R{\&}D and productivity. We also derive a novel estimator for production functions in this setting. Using an unbalanced panel of more than 1800 Spanish manufacturing firms in nine industries during the 1990s, we provide evidence of non-linearities as well as economically significant uncertainties in the R{\&}D process.

	abstract = {We study the cyclical implications of credit market imperfections in a quantitative dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium model wherein firms face persistent shocks to aggregate and individual productivity. In our model economy, optimal capital reallocation is distorted by two frictions: collateralized borrowing and partial investment irreversibil- ity. We find that a negative shock to borrowing conditions can, on its own, generate a large and persistent recession through disruptions to the distribution of capital. This recession, and the subsequent recov- ery, is distinguished both quantitatively and qualitatively from that driven by an exogenous shock to total factor productivity.},

Crowdfunding involves relatively small contributions of many consumer-investors over a fixed time period (generally a few weeks). The purpose of this paper is to add to our empirical understanding of backer dynamics over the project funding cycle. Two years of publicly available data on projects listed on Kickstarter is used to establish that the typical pattern of project support is U-shaped—in general, backers are more likely to contribute to a project in the first and last week as compared to the middle period of the funding cycle. We further establish that this U-shape pattern of support is pervasive across projects, including both successfully and unsuccessfully funded projects, those with large and small goals, and projects in different categories. We then empirically explore the dynamics associated with several factors, including collective attention effects from platform sorting options, the role of family and friends in supporting projects, the effects of social influence, and the role of project updates over the project funding cycle.},

In the context of this structural approach, estimation of the loading matrices for the decomposition into idiosyncratic versus common shocks is straightforward and transparent. The method appears to do remarkably well at uncovering the properties of the sample distribution of the underlying structural dynamics, even when the panels are relatively short, as illustrated in Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, these simulations also illustrate that the SVAR panel method can be used to improve inference, not only for properties of the sample distribution, but also for dynamics of individual members of the panel that lack adequate data for a conventional time series SVAR analysis. This is accomplished by using fitted cross sectional regressions of the sample of estimated panel responses to correlated static measures, and using these to interpolate the member-specific dynamics.},

We propose to estimate the covariance matrix through its matrix logarithm based on an approximate log-likelihood function. We develop a generalization of the Leonard and Hsu log-likelihood approximation that no longer requires a nonsingular sample covariance matrix. The matrix log-transformation provides the ability to impose a convex penalty on the transformed likelihood such that the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix estimate can be regularized simultaneously. The proposed method transforms the problem of estimating the covariance matrix into the problem of estimating a symmetric matrix, which can be solved efficiently by an iterative quadratic programming algorithm. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated by a simulation study and two real applications in classification and portfolio optimization.

	abstract = {This paper studies the response of poor rural households in rural Kenya to large temporary income changes. Using a randomized controlled trial, households were randomly assigned to receive unconditional cash transfers of at least USD 404 from the NGO GiveDirectly. We designed the experiment to address several long-standing questions in the economics literature: what is the shape of households' Engel curves? Do household members effectively pool income? Are there constraints to savings? Do transfers generate externalities? In addition, we study in detail the effects of transfers on psychological well-being and levels of the stress hormone cortisol. We randomized at both the village and household levels; further, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife vs. husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer vs. monthly installments over 9 months), and transfer magnitude (USD 404 vs. USD 1,520). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in monthly consumption from USD 157 to USD 194 four months after the transfer ended. Implied expenditure elasticities for food, medical and education expenditures range between 0.84 and 1.47, while the point estimates are negative for alcohol and tobacco. Intriguingly, recipient gender does not affect the household response to the program. Households may face savings constraints: monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, while lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables. We find no evidence for externalities on non-recipients except for a significant positive spillover on female empowerment. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being, and several types of transfers lead to reductions in levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on consumption and psychological well-being.},

Instead of focusing particular services, as previous studies have done, this book concerns itself with entire private communities. A series of case studies demonstrates how real world communities, such as Walt Disney World, the Reston Association in Virginia and the private neighbourhoods of St Louis, are in fact financing their own public goods and services in accordance with this theory. For such communities to rise and prosper, the author contends, government must eliminate restrictions such as zoning as well as the taxation of private services. After considering the implications of his work for urban economies – at a time when many of America's cities are plagued by decay, violence and poverty – Dr Foldvary argues that prosperity can be restored to cities if private communities are allowed to develop. As an original response to an urgent, contemporary problem this well-written book will be welcomed by social scientists, policy makers and business leaders seeking solutions to problems of urban decay.},

This study systematically evaluates the impacts that this had on land cover change and other associated aspects during the period 1990–2010 using repeat photography and satellite imagery in combination with interviews with community members. The results of the study clearly reflect the success of community-based forest management in the Dolakha district of the mid-hills of Nepal: during the study period, the rate of conversion of sparse forest into dense forest under community-based management was found to be between 1.13{\%} and 3.39{\%} per year. Similarly, the rate of conversion of non-forest area into forest was found to be between 1.11{\%} and 1.96{\%} per year. Community-based forest management has resulted in more efficient use of forest resources, contributed to a decline in the use of slash-and-burn agricultural practices, reduced the incidence of forest fires, spurred tree plantation, and encouraged the conservation and protection of trees on both public and private land. The resulting reclamation of forest in landside areas and river banks and the overall improvement in forest cover in the area has reduced flash floods and associated landslides.},

	abstract = {Funded pension arrangements are recovering gradually from the financial crisis. While the investment losses suffered in 2008 are still far from being fully recouped, two key variables monitored by policymakers, investment returns and funding ratios in defined benefit plans, have shown a marked improvement in the first half of 2009. Official figures for the third quarter of 2009 are still not available for most OECD countries, but the recent market rally points to a further improvement in pension fund performance. Despite these good news, some of the structural challenges faced by private pension systems are yet to be addressed. In particular, the ongoing shift towards defined contribution arrangements calls for an overhaul of regulatory approaches, with default investment options that deliver risk mitigation as members approach retirement. There is also a need to strengthen disclosure requirements and to implement effective financial education programmes. The OECD is continuing its work in these areas and will be publishing reports and policy recommendations over the course of the next year. This sixth issue of Pensions Markets in Focus also presents data on public pensions reserve funds, which have also been severely affected by the crisis in many OECD countries. The information on pension fund investment returns has also been extended to non-OECD countries that participate in the OECD data collection via a cooperation agreement with the International Organisation of Pension Supervisors.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper we present, demonstrate and validate a method for predicting city-wide electricity gains from photovoltaic panels based on detailed 3D urban massing models combined with Daysim-based hourly irradiation simulations, typical meteorological year climactic data and hourly calculated rooftop temperatures. The resulting data can be combined with online mapping technologies and search engines as well as a financial module that provides building owners interested in installing a photovoltaic system on their rooftop with meaningful data regarding spatial placement, system size, installation costs and financial payback. As a proof of concept, a photovoltaic potential map for the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, consisting of over 17,000 rooftops has been implemented as of September 2012.  The new method constitutes the first linking of increasingly available GIS and LiDAR urban datasets with the validated building performance simulation engine Daysim, thus-far used primarily at the scale of individual buildings or small urban neighborhoods. A comparison of the new method with its predecessors reveals significant benefits as it produces hourly point irradiation data, supports better geometric accuracy, considers reflections from near by urban context and uses predicted rooftop temperatures to calculate hourly PV efficiency. A validation study of measured and simulated electricity yields from two rooftop PV installations in Cambridge shows that the new method is able to predict annual electricity gains within 3.6–5.3{\%} of measured production when calibrating for actual weather data and detailed PV panel geometry. This predicted annual error using the new method is shown to be less than the variance which can be expected from climactic variation between years. Furthermore, because the new method generates hourly data, it can be applied to peak load mitigation studies at the urban level. This study also compares predicted monthly energy yields using the new method to those of preceding methods for the two validated test installations and on an annual basis for 10 buildings selected randomly from the Cambridge dataset.},

	abstract = {In contrast to “search goods” whose true quality can be determined before inspection, we examine information goods that are “experience goods” — goods whose true quality can only be determined through use. We analyze a “version-to-upgrade” strategy where a monopolist generates vertically differentiated versions as bridges that lead consumers to experience the goods so that they can assess their true quality, and then provide upgrades to consumers that initially purchase lower quality versions. Adopting a two-stage model, we find that if consumers have homogeneous expectations about quality before experience, then the version-to-upgrade strategy involves upgrading all the consumers that in the first stage purchased the low quality version. In this way, consumers that upgrade effectively pay a tax for learning. When consumers have heterogeneous expectations about quality before experience, if consumers are pessimistic, then the version-to-upgrade strategy still drives all consumers to upgrade. However, if consumers are optimistic, then, the version-to-upgrade strategy may induce only some of the consumers that initially purchased the low quality version to upgrade.

Both asset liquidity and central bank haircuts are modeled as power functions within the unit interval. Funding stability is captured as strategic bank run game in pure strategies between depositors. Asset liquidity, the central bank collateral framework and regulation determine jointly the ability of the banking system to deliver maturity transformation and financial stability. The model also explains why banks tend to use the least liquid eligible assets as central bank collateral and why a sudden non-anticipated reduction of asset liquidity, or a tightening of the collateral framework, can destabilize short term liabilities of banks. Finally, the model allows discussing how the collateral framework can be understood, beyond its essential aim to protect the central bank, as financial stability and non-conventional monetary policy instrument.},

We find the current recessionary period coincided with an almost 20{\%} increase in alcoholism-related searches. Controlling for state and time-effects, a 5{\%} rise in unemployment is followed in the next 12 months by an approximate 15{\%} increase in searches. The use of Internet searches to inform on health-related behaviours and outcomes is in its infancy; but we suggest that the data provides important real-time information for policy-makers and can help to overcome the under-reporting in surveys of sensitive information. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Schmidt2013,
	abstract = {Despite similar levels of per capita income, education and technology, the development of labour income shares in OECD countries has displayed different patterns since 1960. The paper examines the role of demography in this regard. We first use a standard overlapping generations model to derive the mechanisms by which demographic change can affect the labour share. It turns out that demographic change can affect the labour share either by altering the domestic capital intensity, by causing factor-biased technological change or in a small open economy framework by creating a gap between domestic savings and investments. The latter affects the country's investments abroad and in return its net foreign asset income which directly leads to changes in the labour share. Empirical estimations based on these insights, provide evidence that an increases in the expected retirement durations and old-age dependency ratios as well as declines in labour force growth rates have indeed been major forces behind the decline in labour shares that took place in many countries. These effects tend to be larger in open economies and pension reforms towards a funded pension system seem to have accelerated the effects. CR  - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2013 Springer},

In this study, a framework is proposed to integrate Geographical Information Systems (GIS), mathematical optimization, and simulation modules to obtain the annual optimal placement and size of PV units for the next two decades in a campus area environment. First, a GIS module is developed to find the suitable rooftops and their panel capacity considering the amount of solar radiation, slope, elevation, and aspect. The optimization module is then used to maximize the long-term net profit of PV installations considering various costs of investment, inverter replacement, operation, and maintenance as well as savings from consuming less conventional energy. A voltage profile of the electricity distribution network is then investigated in the simulation module. In the case of voltage limit violation by intermittent PV generations or load fluctuations, two mitigation strategies, reallocation of the PV units or installation of a local storage unit, are suggested. The proposed framework has been implemented in a real campus area, and the results show that it can effectively be used for long-term installation planning of PV panels considering both the cost and power quality. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

When the economy relies on such informationally insensitive debt, firms with low quality collateral can borrow, generating a credit boom and an increase in output. Financial fragility is endogenous; it builds up over time as information about counterparties decays. A crisis occurs when a ( possibly small) shock causes agents to suddenly have incentives to produce information, leading to a decline in output.

	abstract = {In 2007, countries in the euro zone periphery were enjoying stable growth, low deficits, and low spreads. Then the financial crisis erupted and pushed them into deep recessions, raising their deficits and debt levels. By 2010, they were facing severe debt problems. Spreads increased and, surprisingly, so did the share of the debt held by domestic creditors. Credit was reallocated from the private sector to the public sector, reducing investment and deepening the recessions even further. To account for these facts, we propose a simple model of sovereign risk in which debt can be traded in secondary markets. The model has two key ingredients: creditor discrimination and crowding-out effects. Creditor discrimination arises because, in turbulent times, sovereign debt offers a higher expected return to domestic creditors than to foreign ones. This provides incentives for domestic purchases of debt. Crowding-out effects arise because private borrowing is limited by financial frictions. This implies that domestic debt purchases displace productive investment. The model shows that these purchases reduce growth and welfare, and may lead to self-fulfilling crises. It also shows how crowding-out effects can be transmitted to other countries in the euro zone, and how they may be addressed by policies at the European level. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Increasing longevity favours the PAYG system because for the workers living longer at retirement than current retirees, it is less costly to fund others' current pensions than their own. At present, the effect amounts to around 15 per cent in terms of the dependency ratio, or six more years at work in the FS, or 1 per cent per annum in terms of the real interest rate.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past decade, the United States has seen declining energy intakes and plateauing obesity levels. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether these observed trends suggest a longer-term shift in dietary and health behavior that is independent of adverse economic conditions. DESIGN: We used nationally representative cross-sectional surveys on intake and longitudinal household food purchase data along with random-effects models to address this question. Data included individuals in NHANES 2003-2004 to 2009-2010 (children: n = 13,422; adults: n = 10,791) and households from the 2000-2011 Nielsen Homescan Panel (households with children: n = 57,298; households with adults only: n = 108,932). RESULTS: In both data sets, we showed that children decreased their calories the most. Even after we controlled for important socioeconomic factors, caloric purchases fell significantly from 2003 to 2011 (P {\textless} 0.001), particularly for households with children. The Great Recession was associated with small increases in caloric purchases, in which a 1-percentage point increase in unemployment in the local market was associated with a 1.6-4.1-kcal {\textperiodcentered} capita⁻¹ {\textperiodcentered} d⁻¹ (P {\textless} 0.001) increase in total calories purchased. Results also indicated shifts in caloric purchases were driven more by declines in caloric purchases from beverages than food. CONCLUSIONS: US consumers have exhibited changes in intake and purchasing behavior since 2003 that were independent from changing economic conditions linked with the Great Recession or food prices. Public health efforts in the past decade may have contributed to this trend.},

Despite the similarities between the two stimulus policies, there were important differences in both their design and the prevailing economic conditions. We use the model of Kaplan and Violante (2013) to compare the consumption response to these policies. Consistent with empirical evidence from microdata, we find that the consumption response was around one-third lower in 2008, primarily due to the larger size of the payments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Application of ATP and alpha,beta-meATP to neurons showed they possessed a predominantly nondesensitizing P2X receptor type insensitive to alpha,beta-meATP, consistent with immunohistochemical observations. P2X(1)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used to study the time course of P2X(1) receptor clustering in plasma membranes of neurons and internalization of receptors following prolonged exposure to ATP. At 12-24 h after adenoviral infection, P2X(1)-GFP formed clusters about 1 microm diameter in the neuron membrane. Application of ATP and alpha,beta-meATP showed these neurons possessed a predominantly desensitizing P2X receptor type sensitive to alpha,beta-meATP. Infection converted the major functional P2X receptor type in the membrane to P2X(1). Exposure of infected neurons to alpha,beta-meATP for less than 60 s led to the disappearance of P2X(1)-GFP fluorescence from the cell surface that was blocked by monensin, indicating the chimera is normally endocytosed into these organelles on exposure to agonist.},

@article{Resch2014,
	abstract = {In the face of the broad political call for an “energy turnaround”, we are currently witnessing three essential trends with regard to energy infrastructure planning, energy generation and storage: from planned production towards fluctuating production on the basis of renewable energy sources, from centralized generation towards decentralized generation and from expensive energy carriers towards cost-free energy carriers. These changes necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Even though most of these modifications are inherently motivated by geospatial questions and challenges, the integration of energy system models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of previous approaches in using GIS in renewable energy-related projects, extracts distinct challenges from these previous efforts and, finally, defines a set of core future research avenues for GIS-based energy infrastructure planning with a focus on the use of renewable energy. These future research avenues comprise the availability base data and their “geospatial awareness”, the development of a generic and unified data model, the usage of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and crowdsourced data in analysis processes, the integration of 3D building models and 3D data analysis, the incorporation of network topologies into GIS, the harmonization of the heterogeneous views on aggregation issues in the fields of energy and GIS, fine-grained energy demand estimation from freely-available data sources, decentralized storage facility planning, the investigation of GIS-based public participation mechanisms, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, data privacy aspects and, finally, the development of a new dynamic power market design.},

	abstract = {In this paper we derive the asymptotic properties of GMM estimators for the spatial dynamic panel data model with fixed effects when n is large, and T can be large, but small relative to n. The GMM estimation methods are designed with the fixed individual and time effects eliminated from the model, and are computationally tractable even under circumstances where the ML approach would be either infeasible or computationally complicated. The ML approach would be infeasible if the spatial weights matrix is not row-normalized while the time effects are eliminated, and would be computationally intractable if there are multiple spatial weights matrices in the model; also, consistency of the MLE would require T to be large and not small relative to n if the fixed effects are jointly estimated with other parameters of interest. The GMM approach can overcome all these difficulties. We use exogenous and predetermined variables as instruments for linear moments, along with several levels of their neighboring variables and additional quadratic moments. We stack up the data and construct the best linear and quadratic moment conditions. An alternative approach is to use separate moment conditions for each period, which gives rise to many moments estimation. We show that these GMM estimators are nT consistent, asymptotically normal, and can be relatively efficient. We compare these approaches on their finite sample performance by Monte Carlo. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Goodwin2014,
	abstract = {The federal crop insurance program has been a major fixture of U.S. agricultural policy since the 1930s, and continues to grow in size and importance. Indeed, it now represents the most prominent farm policy instrument, accounting for more government spending than any other farm commodity program. The 2014 Farm Bill further expanded the crop insurance program and introduced a number of new county-level revenue insurance plans. In 2013, over {\$}123 billion in crop value was insured under the program. Crop revenue insurance, first introduced in the 1990s, now accounts for nearly 70{\%} of the total liability in the program. The available plans cover losses that result from a revenue shortfall that can be triggered by multiple, dependent sources of risk—either low prices, low yields, or a combination of both. The actuarial practices currently applied when rating these plans essentially involve the application of a Gaussian copula model to the pricing of dependent risks. We evaluate the suitability of this assumption by considering a number of alternative copula models. In particular, we use combinations of pair-wise copulas of conditional distributions to model multiple sources of risk. We find that this approach is generally preferred by model-fitting criteria in the applications considered here. We demonstrate that alternative approaches to modeling dependencies in a portfolio of risks may have significant implications for premium rates in crop insurance.},

We use longitudinal survey data that include pre- and post-reports from the same individuals on a range of health-compromising and health-promoting behaviors. We find that the crisis led to large and significant reductions in health-compromising behaviors (such as smoking, drinking alcohol or soft drinks, and eating sweets) and certain health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fruits and vegetables), but to increases in other health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fish oil and recommended sleep). The magnitudes of effects for smoking are somewhat larger than what has been found in past research in other contexts, while those for alcohol, fruits, and vegetables are in line with estimates from other studies. Changes in work hours, real income, financial assets, mortgage debt, and mental health, together, explain the effects of the crisis on some behaviors (such as consumption of sweets and fast food), while the effects of the crisis on most other behaviors appear to have operated largely through price increases. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Working with concentrated estimating equation simplifies greatly the high-order expansions for bias and variance; a simple bootstrap procedure overcomes a major difficulty in analytically evaluating expectations of various quantities in the expansions. The method is then studied in detail using a more general SAR model, with its effectiveness in correcting bias and improving inference fully demonstrated by extensive Monte Carlo experiments. Compared with the analytical approach, the proposed approach is much simpler and has a much wider applicability. The validity of the bootstrap procedure is formally established. The proposed method is then extended to the case of more than one nonlinear estimator.},

	abstract = {Abstract Smallholder tree plantation, now on the increase in Indonesia, has long been practiced by rural farmers as a strategy to optimize the expected utility of land, labor and other constraints. Increasing demand for timber has driven a shift toward commercialization of smallholder forestry. However, smallholders face huge challenges when they seek for commercial markets in the form of complex regulatory frameworks applied to smallholder plantations. This paper discusses the case of smallholder plantations in Gunungkidul District (Indonesia), considered one of the most commercialized timber marketing hubs for local, national and international markets. It analyzes how opportunities and challenges, resulted from different regulatory frameworks, affect the competitiveness of smallholder forestry practices. In this paper, regulatory frameworks are defined as not only regulations issued by public administrators at the domestic (local and national) level, but also cover the emerging market-based regulatory frameworks, i.e. voluntary certification of sustainable forestry and mandatory timber legality verification.},

Among funded projects, a failure to deliver seems relatively rare, accounting for around 9{\%} of all projects, with a possible range of 5{\%} to 14{\%}. There are few indicators at the time of project funding as to which projects might ultimately fail to deliver rewards, though small projects (and to a lesser extent very large projects) are more likely to fail to deliver rewards, as are some project categories. The demographics of project creators (including gender, education level, and family status) did not significantly affect the chance of a project succeeding.},

	abstract = {Economic crises are complex events that affect behavioral patterns (including alcohol consumption) via opposing mechanisms. With this realist systematic review, we aimed to investigate evidence from studies of previous or ongoing crises on which mechanisms (How?) play a role among which individuals (Whom?). Such evidence would help understand and predict the potential impact of economic crises on alcohol consumption. Medical, psychological, social, and economic databases were used to search for peer-reviewed qualitative or quantitative empirical evidence (published January 1, 1990-May 1, 2014) linking economic crises or stressors with alcohol consumption and alcohol-related health problems. We included 35 papers, based on defined selection criteria. From these papers, we extracted evidence on mechanism(s), determinant, outcome, country-level context, and individual context. We found 16 studies that reported evidence completely covering two behavioral mechanisms by which economic crises can influence alcohol consumption and alcohol-related health problems. The first mechanism suggests that psychological distress triggered by unemployment and income reductions can increase drinking problems. The second mechanism suggests that due to tighter budget constraints, less money is spent on alcoholic beverages. Across many countries, the psychological distress mechanism was observed mainly in men. The tighter budget constraints mechanism seems to play a role in all population subgroups across all countries. For the other three mechanisms (i.e., deterioration in the social situation, fear of losing one's job, and increased non-working time), empirical evidence was scarce or absent, or had small to moderate coverage. This was also the case for important influential contextual factors described in our initial theoretical framework. This realist systematic review suggests that among men (but not among women), the net impact of economic crises will be an increase in harmful drinking. Such a different net impact between men and women could potentially contribute to growing gender-related health inequalities during a crisis.},

Recent advances in the clustering literature allow for fast and efficient computation. We provide conditions under which our estimator is consistent as both dimensions of the panel tend to infinity, and we develop inference methods. Finally, we allow for grouped patterns of unobserved heterogeneity in the study of the link between income and democracy across countries.},

	abstract = {This paper considers model selection in panels where incidental parameters are present. Primary interest centers on selecting a model that best approximates the underlying structure involving parameters that are common within the panel. It is well known that conventional model selection procedures are often inconsistent in panel models and this can be so even without nuisance parameters. Modifications are then needed to achieve consistency. New model selection information criteria are developed here that use either the Kullback-Leibler information criterion based on the profile likelihood or the Bayes factor based on the integrated likelihood with a bias-reducing prior. These model selection criteria impose heavier penalties than those associated with standard information criteria such as AIC and BIC. The additional penalty, which is data-dependent, properly reflects the model complexity arising from the presence of incidental parameters. A particular example is studied in detail involving lag order selection in dynamic panel models with fixed effects. The new criteria are shown to control for over/under-selection probabilities in these models and lead to consistent order selection criteria.},

	abstract = {Abstract The bi-directional influences between emotion and food consumption are discussed in view of recent efforts to find emotional factors that influence food choice and eating- and drinking behaviour independently from traditional factors as liking, wanting and appropriateness. Distinctions are made between conscious and unconscious emotions and their relative importance in food-related behaviour is discussed. In response to eating disorders like obesity, much more is known about the influence of emotion and mood on food choice and intake than about the influence of food on mood and emotion, which only recently gained prominence in food-related emotion research. This led to a number of emotion measurement methods that differ strongly in their explicit or implicit measurement approach and in the extent to which they demand conscious emotion awareness and verbal understanding on the part of the participants. These methods are critically discussed and questions are raised about the specificity of their emotional contents and about their use at different moments in time, such as before, during and at different moments after consumption. Furthermore, doubts were raised about the independency of their contributions from the traditional measurements (liking, wanting and appropriateness) and suggestions are made for improving the practical applicability of an efficient emotion measurement.},

	abstract = {Abstract Community-managed forests (CMF) provide vital ecosystem services (ES) for local communities. However, the status and trend of ES in CMF have not been assessed in many developing countries because of a lack of appropriate data, tools, appropriate policy or management framework. Using a case study of community-managed forested landscape in central Nepal, this paper aims to identify and map priority ES and assess the temporal change in the provision of ES between 1990 and 2013. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, transect walks and participatory mapping were used to identify and assess priority ES. The results indicated that community forestry has resulted in the substantial restoration of forests on degraded lands over the period of 1990–2013. Local community members and experts consider that this restoration has resulted in a positive impact on various ES beneficial for local, regional, national and international users. Priority ES identified in the study included timber, firewood, freshwater, carbon sequestration, water regulation, soil protection, landscape beauty as well as biodiversity. There were strong variations in the valuation of different ES between local people and experts, between genders and between different status and income classes in the local communities. In general, whereas CMF provide considerable benefits at larger scales, local people have yet to perceive the real value of these different ES provided by their forest management efforts. The study demonstrated that participatory tools, combined with free-access satellite images and repeat photography are suitable approaches to engage local communities in discussions regarding ES and to map and prioritise ES values.},

	abstract = {We propose the use of likelihood-based confidence sets for the timing of structural breaks in parameters from time series regression models. The confidence sets are valid for the broad setting of a system of multivariate linear regression equations under fairly general assumptions about the error and regressors and allowing for multiple breaks in mean and variance parameters. In our asymptotic analysis, we determine the critical values for a likelihood ratio test of a break date and the expected length of a likelihood-based confidence set constructed by inverting the likelihood ratio test. Notably, the likelihood-based confidence set is considerably shorter than for other methods employed in the literature. Monte Carlo analysis confirms better performance than other methods in terms of length and coverage accuracy in finite samples, including when the magnitude of breaks is small. An application to postwar U.S. real GDP and consumption leads to a much tighter 95{\%} confidence set for the timing of the “Great Moderation” in the mid-1980s than previously found. Furthermore, when taking cointegration between output and consumption into account, confidence sets for structural break dates are even more precise and suggest a sudden “productivity growth slowdown” in the early 1970s and an additional large, abrupt decline in long-run growth in the mid-1990s.},

Assuming that the number of factors used in estimation is larger than the true number of factors in the data we establish the limiting distribution of the LS estimator for the regression coefficients, as the number of time periods and the number of crosssectional units jointly go to infinity. The main result of the paper is that under certain assumptions the limiting distribution of the LS estimator is independent of the number of factors used in the estimation, as long as this number is not underestimated. The important practical implication of this result is that for inference on the regression coefficients one does not necessarily need to estimate the number of interactive fixed effects consistently.},

Post-tax energy subsidies are dramatically higher than previously estimated and are projected to remain high. These subsidies primarily reflect underpricing from a domestic (rather than global) perspective, so that unilateral price reform is in countries' own interests.

However, there is little knowledge about preferences of households living in community managed forests for REDD contracts, or the opportunity costs of accepting REDD contracts for these communities. This paper uses a choice experiment survey of rural communities in Nepal to understand respondents' preferences toward the institutional structure of REDD contracts. The sample is split across communities with community managed forests groups and those without community managed forest groups to see how prior involvement in community managed forest groups affects preferences. The results show that respondents care about how the payments are divided between households and communities, the severity of restrictions on firewood use, the restrictions on grazing, and the fairness of access to community managed forest resources as well as the level of payments. The preferences for REDD contracts are in general similar between community managed and non-community managed forest resource respondents, but there are differences, in particular with regard to how beliefs influence the likelihood of accepting the contracts. Finally, the paper finds that the opportunity cost of REDD payments, although cheaper than many other carbon dioxide abatement options, is higher than previously suggested in the literature.},

@article{Gagnon2016,
	abstract = {How much energy could be generated if PV modules were installed on all of the suitable roof area in the nation? To answer this question, we first use GIS methods to process a lidar dataset and determine the amount of roof area that is suitable for PV deployment in 128 cities nationwide, containing 23{\%} of U.S. buildings, and provide PV-generation results for a subset of those cities. We then extend the insights from that analysis to the entire continental United States. We develop two statistical models--one for small buildings and one for medium and large buildings--and populate them with geographic variables that correlate with rooftop's suitability for PV. We simulate the productivity of PV installed on the suitable roof area, and present the technical potential of PV on both small buildings and medium/large buildings for every state in the continental US. Within the 128 cities covered by lidar data, 83{\%} of small buildings have a location suitable for a PV installation, but only 26{\%} of the total rooftop area of small buildings is suitable for development. The sheer number of buildings in this class, however, gives small buildings the greatest technical potential. Small building rooftops could accommodate 731 GW of PV capacity and generate 926 TWh/year of PV energy, approximately 65{\%} of rooftop PV's total technical potential. We conclude by summing the PV-generation results for all building sizes and therefore answering our original question, estimating that the total national technical potential of rooftop PV is 1,118 GW of installed capacity and 1,432 TWh of annual energy generation. This equates to 39{\%} of total national electric-sector sales.},

The setting allows the number of time-varying regressors to be larger than the sample size. To make informative estimation and inference feasible, we require that the overall contribution of the time-varying variables after eliminating the individual specific heterogeneity can be captured by a relatively small number of the available variables whose identities are unknown. This restriction allows the problem of estimation to proceed as a variable selection problem. Importantly, we treat the individual specific heterogeneity as fixed effects which allows this heterogeneity to be related to the observed time-varying variables in an unspecified way and allows that this heterogeneity may differ for all individuals. Within this framework, we provide procedures that give uniformly valid inference over a fixed subset of parameters in the canonical linear fixed effects model and over coefficients on a fixed vector of endogenous variables in panel data instrumental variable models with fixed effects and many instruments. We present simulation results in support of the theoretical developments and illustrate the use of the methods in an application aimed at estimating the effect of gun prevalence on crime rates.},

Health-compromising behaviors (smoking, heavy drinking, sugared soft drinks, sweets, fast food, and tanning) declined during the crisis, and all but sweets continued to decline during the recovery. Health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fruit, fish oil, and vitamins/minerals and getting recommended sleep) followed more idiosyncratic paths. Overall, most behaviors reverted back to their pre-crisis levels or trends during the recovery, and these short-term deviations in trajectories were probably too short-lived in this recession to have major impacts on health or mortality. A notable exception is for binge drinking, which declined by 10{\%} during the 2 crisis years, continued to fall (at a slower rate of 8{\%}) during the 3 recovery years, and did not revert back to the upward pre-crisis trend during our observation period. These lingering effects, which directionally run counter to the pre-crisis upward trend in consumption and do not reflect price increases during the recovery period, suggest that alcohol is a potential pathway by which recessions improve health and/or reduce mortality.},

	abstract = {The Agricultural Act of 2014 solidified insurance as the cornerstone of U.S. agricultural policy. The Congressional Budget Office (2014) estimates that this act will increase spending on agri-cultural insurance programs by {\$}5.7 billion to a total of {\$}89.8 billion over the next decade. In light of the sizable resources directed toward these programs, accurate rating of insurance con-tracts is of the utmost importance to producers, private insurance companies, and the federal government. Unlike most forms of insurance, agricultural insurance is plagued by a paucity of spatially correlated data. A novel interpretation of Bayesian Model Averaging is used to estimate a set of possibly similar densities that offers greater efficiency if the set of densities are similar while seemingly not losing any if the set of densities are dissimilar. Simulations indicate that finite sample performance—in particular small sample performance—is quite promising. The proposed approach does not require knowledge of the form or extent of any possible similarities, is relatively easy to implement, admits correlated data, and can be used with either parametric or nonparametric estimators. We use the proposed approach to estimate U.S. crop insurance pre-mium rates for area-type programs and develop a test to evaluate its efficacy. An out-of-sample game between private insurance companies and the federal government highlights the policy implications for a variety of crop-state combinations. Consistent with the simulation results, the performance of the proposed approach with respect to rating area-type insurance—in particular small sample performance—remains quite promising.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of forecasting a collection of short time series using cross sectional information in panel data. We construct point predictors using Tweedie's formula for the posterior mean of heterogeneous coefficients under a correlated random effects distribution. This formula utilizes cross-sectional information to transform the unit-specifc (quasi) maximum likelihood estimator into an approximation of the posterior mean under a prior distribution that equals the population distribution of the random coefficients. We show that the risk of a predictor based on a non-parametric estimate of the Tweedie correction is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of a predictor that treats the correlated-random-effects distribution as known (ratio-optimality). Our empirical Bayes predictor performs well compared to various competitors in a Monte Carlo study. In an empirical application we use the predictor to forecast revenues for a large panel of bank holding companies and compare forecasts that condition on actual and severely adverse macroeconomic conditions. },

	abstract = {In finite samples, the use of a slightly endogenous but highly relevant instrument can reduce mean-squared error (MSE). Building on this observation, I propose a novel moment selection procedure for GMM–the Focused Moment Selection Criterion (FMSC)–in which moment conditions are chosen not based on their validity but on the MSE of their associated estimator of a user-specified target parameter. The FMSC mimics the situation faced by an applied researcher who begins with a set of relatively mild “baseline” assumptions and must decide whether to impose any of a collection of stronger but more controversial “suspect” assumptions. When the (correctly specified) baseline moment conditions identify the model, the FMSC provides an asymptotically unbiased estimator of asymptotic MSE, allowing us to select over the suspect moment conditions. I go on to show how the framework used to derive the FMSC can address the problem of inference post-moment selection. Treating post-selection estimators as a special case of moment-averaging, in which estimators based on different moment sets are given data-dependent weights, I propose simulation-based procedures for inference that can be applied to a variety of formal and informal moment-selection and averaging procedures. Both the FMSC and confidence interval procedures perform well in simulations. I conclude with an empirical example examining the effect of instrument selection on the estimated relationship between malaria and income per capita.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Econometric Society Confidence intervals are commonly used to describe parameter uncertainty. In nonstandard problems, however, their frequentist coverage property does not guarantee that they do so in a reasonable fashion. For instance, confidence intervals may be empty or extremely short with positive probability, even if they are based on inverting powerful tests. We apply a betting framework and a notion of bet-proofness to formalize the “reasonableness” of confidence intervals as descriptions of parameter uncertainty, and use it for two purposes. First, we quantify the violations of bet-proofness for previously suggested confidence intervals in nonstandard problems. Second, we derive alternative confidence sets that are bet-proof by construction. We apply our framework to several nonstandard problems involving weak instruments, near unit roots, and moment inequalities. We find that previously suggested confidence intervals are not bet-proof, and numerically determine alternative bet-proof confidence sets.},

Modeling the variables' conditional mean processes using a multiplicative error model, we map the resulting residuals into a Gaussian domain using a copula-type transformation. Based on high-frequency volatility, cumulative trading volumes, trade counts and market depth of various stocks traded at the NYSE, we show that the proposed transformation is supported by the data and allows capturing (multivariate) dynamics in higher order moments. The latter are modeled using a DCC-GARCH specification. We suggest estimating the model by composite maximum likelihood which is sufficiently flexible to be applicable in high dimensions. Strong empirical evidence for time-varying conditional (co-)variances in trading processes supports the usefulness of the approach. Taking these higher-order dynamics explicitly into account significantly improves the goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecasts of the multiplicative error model.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces shrinkage for general parametric models. We show how to shrink maximum likelihood estimators towards parameter subspaces defined by general nonlinear restrictions. We derive the asymptotic distribution and risk of our shrinkage estimator using a local asymptotic framework. We show that if the shrinkage dimension exceeds two, the asymptotic risk of the shrinkage estimator is strictly less than that of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). This reduction holds globally in the parameter space. We show that the reduction in asymptotic risk is substantial, even for moderately large values of the parameters. We also provide a new high-dimensional large sample local minimax efficiency bound. The bound is the lowest possible asymptotic risk, uniformly in a local region of the parameter space. Local minimax bounds are a stronger efficiency characterization than global minimax bounds. We show that our shrinkage estimator asymptotically achieves this local asymptotic minimax bound, while the MLE does not. Thus the shrinkage estimator, unlike the MLE, is locally minimax efficient. This theory is a combination and extension of standard asymptotic efficiency theory (H{\'{a}}jek, 1972) and local minimax efficiency theory for Gaussian models (Pinsker, 1980).},

Over time, various forms of community-based forestry have evolved in different countries, but all have at their heart the notion of some level of participation by smallholders and community groups in planning and implementation. This publication is FAO's rst comprehensive look at the impact of community-based forestry since previous reviews in 1991 and 2001. It considers both collaborative regimes (forestry practised on land with formal communal tenure requiring collective action) and smallholder forestry (on land that is generally privately owned). The publication examines the extent of community-based forestry globally and regionally and assesses its effectiveness in delivering on key biophysical and socioeconomic outcomes, i.e. moving towards sustainable forest management and improving local livelihoods. The report is targeted at policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, communities and civil society.},

We exploit both the differences between unaffected state government employees and affected federal employees as well as between federal employees required to remain at work and those required to stay at home to generate variation in income and available time. We find strong evidence for excess sensitivity of consumption patterns, violating the permanent income hypothesis.

We discern detailed categories of household spending with widely varying elasticities.

Furthermore, in finite samples both likelihood estimators might lead to a negative estimate of the variance of the individual-specific effects. We consider different approaches taking into account the non-negativity restriction for the variance. We show that these approaches may lead to a solution different from the unique global unconstrained maximum. In an extensive Monte Carlo study we find that this issue is non-negligible for small values of T and that different approaches might lead to different finite sample properties. Furthermore, we find that the Likelihood Ratio statistic provides size control in small samples, albeit with low power due to the flatness of the log-likelihood function.

This paper presents model specification and proposes QMLE estimation of spatial dynamic panel data models with endogenous time varying spatial weights matrices. Asymptotic properties of the proposed QMLE are rigorously established. We extend the notion of spatial near-epoch dependence to allow time dependence. By using spatial-time LLN for near-epoch dependence process and CLT for martingale difference sequence, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of QMLE. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimators have satisfactory finite sample performance.},

To address this problem, we promote a nonlinear shrinkage estimator that is more flexible than previous linear shrinkage estimators and has just the right number of free parameters (that is, the Goldilocks principle).

Our nonlinear shrinkage estimator is asymptotically optimal for portfolio selection when the number of assets is of the same magnitude as the sample size.

	abstract = {Abstract This study proposes a methodology for risk analysis and portfolio optimization of power generation assets with hydro, wind, and solar power, considering the Regulated Contracting Environment and the Mechanism for Reallocation of Energy in Brazil. Innovative stochastic models are used to generate synthetic time series for the random variables water inflow, wind speed, solar irradiance, temperature of the photovoltaic panel, and average generation capacity of the Mechanism for Reallocation of Energy. The simulation is implemented using the Monte Carlo method associated with a Cholesky decomposition. An economic approach is presented taking into account taxation and financing, as well as the Markowitz Portfolio theory. The results show that the initial correlation between the energy resources is altered by the cash flow model and mainly by the debt. In the diversification process, the complementarity between sources helps to reduce the economic risk. The increase in debt increases the correlation, decreases the return and risk and, consequently, affects the diversification process and economic results. The Mechanism for Reallocation of Energy significantly reduces the hydroelectric economic risk and increases the financial return, which directly benefits the formation of portfolios.},

We focus on semiparametric models with unobserved individual and time effects, where the distribution of the outcome variable conditional on covariates and unobserved effects is specified parametrically, while the distribution of the unobserved effects is left unrestricted. Compared to existing reviews on long panels (Arellano and Hahn 2007; a section in Arellano and Bonhomme 2011) we discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel Jackknife bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and other extensions. Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias caused by the estimation of many fixed effects is our main focus, and the unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula p/n for all models discussed, with p the number of estimated parameters and n the total sample size.},

In doing so, we first generate an appropriate database that identifies each industrial production sector with its corresponding price of consumer goods for the euro area. We next estimate a constrained vector autoregressive model. Our findings show a statistically significant increase in producer prices after an oil price shock for branches with high oil consumptions, although this statistical pass-through is only partial. However, there is no evidence of a significant oil price pass-through to consumer prices for most branches, which suggests the adaptability of European producers from the most branches to higher oil price pressures without transmitting them to consumers (exceptions: mining, chemical and metal).},

Within each generation we distinguish individuals with high, medium or low ability to build human capital. Our simulation results prefer a pay-as-you-go pension system with a particular earnings-related linkage above a fully-funded private system. This pay-as-you-go system conditions pension benefits on past individual labor income, with a high weight on labor income earned when older and a low weight on labor income earned when young. Uncorrected, however, such a system implies welfare losses for current low-ability generations and rising inequality. Complementing or replacing it by basic and/or minimum pension components is negative for aggregate employment and welfare. Better is to maintain the tight link between individual labor income and the pension also for low-ability individuals, but to strongly raise their replacement rate. An additional correction improving the welfare of low-ability individuals would be to maintain for these individuals equal weights on past labor income.},

	abstract = {This paper contributes to the GMM literature by introducing the idea of self-instrumenting target variables instead of searching for instruments that are uncorrelated with the errors, in cases where the correlation between the target variables and the errors can be derived. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in the fact that, by construction, the instruments have maximum correlation with the target variables and the problem of weak instrument is thus avoided. The proposed approach can be applied to estimation of a variety of models such as spatial and dynamic panel data models. In this paper we focus on the latter and consider both univariate and multivariate panel data models with short time dimension. Simple Bias-corrected Methods of Moments (BMM) estimators are proposed and shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, under very general conditions on the initialization of the processes, individual-specific effects, and error variances allowing for heteroscedasticity over time as well as cross-sectionally. Monte Carlo evidence document BMM's good small sample performance across different experimental designs and sample sizes, including in the case of experiments where the system GMM estimators are inconsistent. We also find that the proposed estimator does not suffer size distortions and has satisfactory power performance as compared to other estimators.},

The number of skeletal oxygen atoms n = 5 or 6 (coded C16O5 or C16O6) so that the helix formed by association of neighbouring side groups R, has 18 or 21 skeletal bonds per rotation and so imitates the PEOLi + or PEONa+ 21 helix. Complexes with LiBF4 in stoichiometries of 1 mol salt per structural (helical) repeat unit and 0.5 mol per repeat have been prepared. Small-angle- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis and hot stage polarised light microscopy have been used to show that the complexes form smectic systems in the uncomplexed and complexed forms. In the complexes, cations are enclosed within the helices and the anions lie between planes of helices and the alkyl side chains so that the overall d spacing is 42.9 {\AA}. The -C16H33 side chains melt at ca. 40 °C in the complexed material, to give a liquid crystal phase. The liquid crystal-isotropic transition varies slightly according to polymer and stoichiometry and is 89 °C for C16O5:LiBF4 (1:1). The ionic conductivity-temperature relationship shows well-defined transitions at the phase changes and the complex impedance behaviour also reflects the several states of the system. The conductivity of the (1:1) complex is higher than the (1:0.5) complex and is comparable to P(EO)6:LiBF4 in the crystal and istropic phases, but is somewhat lower over the temperature range of the liquid crystal phase.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new method for deriving covariance matrix estimators that are decision-theoretically optimal within a class of nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The key is to employ large-dimensional asymptotics: the matrix dimension and the sample size go to infinity together, with their ratio converging to a finite, nonzero limit. As the main focus, we apply this method to Stein's loss. Compared to the estimator of Stein (1975, 1986), ours has five theoretical advantages: (1) it asymptotically minimizes the loss itself, instead of an estimator of the expected loss; (2) it does not necessitate post-processing via an ad hoc algorithm (called “isotonization”) to restore the positivity or the ordering of the covariance matrix eigenvalues; (3) it does not ignore any terms in the function to be minimized; (4) it does not require normality; and (5) it is not limited to applications where the sample size exceeds the dimension. In addition to these theoretical advantages, our estimator also improves upon Stein's estimator in terms of finite-sample performance, as evidenced via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we show that some previously suggested estimators of the covariance matrix and its inverse are decision-theoretically optimal in the large-dimensional asymptotic limit with respect to the Frobenius loss function.},

We assume that coefficients associated with domestic lagged endogenous variables arise from a Gaussian mixture model. Shrinkage on the cluster size is introduced through suitable priors on the component weights and cluster-relevant quantities are identified through novel shrinkage priors. To assess whether dynamic interdependencies between economies are needed, we moreover impose shrinkage priors on the coefficients related to other countries' endogenous variables. Finally, our model controls for static interdependencies by assuming that the reduced form shocks of the model feature a factor stochastic volatility structure. We assess the merits of the proposed approach by using synthetic data as well as a real data application.

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the estimation of a dynamic panel autoregressive (AR) process of possibly infinite order in the presence of individual effects. We employ double asymptotics under which both the cross-sectional sample size and the length of time series tend to infinity and utilize the sieve AR approximation with its lag order increasing with the sample size. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the fixed effects estimator and propose a bias-corrected fixed effects estimator based on a theoretical asymptotic bias term. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the usefulness of bias correction. As an illustration, the proposed methods are applied to dynamic panel estimation of the law of one price deviations among US cities.},

	abstract = {Many spatial panel data sets exhibit cross sectional and/or intertemporal dependence from spatial interactions or common factors. In an application of a spatial autoregressive model, a spatial weights matrix may be constructed from variables that may correlate with unobservables in the main equation and therefore is endogenous. Some common factors may be unobserved and correlate with included regressors in the equation. This paper presents a unified approach to model spatial panels with endogenous time varying spatial weights matrices and unobserved common factors. We show that the proposed QML estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. As its limiting distribution may have a leading order bias, an analytical bias correction is proposed. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate good finite sample properties of the estimators. This model is empirically applied to examine the effects of house price dynamics on reverse mortgage origination rates in the United States.},

However, empirical studies of the link change are few. In this paper, we investigate the effects of pension privatization and the central government's subsidy to individual accounts on public education spending in a three-period overlapping generation model. And then, we take contemporary pension reforms in a number of Chinese provinces as offering natural experiment conditions. Using a difference-in-difference framework and 282 municipal districts panel data over years 1998–2009, we test the pension-education theoretical link change. Both our theoretical and empirical results confirm that pension privatization is adversely associated with local public spending on education in China. Private pension subsidies, moreover, magnify this effect. Our study supports the theoretical assertion and selective empirical findings of a negative intergenerational effect of pension privatization.},

A large literature in econometrics has developed procedures for detecting weak instruments and constructing robust confidence sets, but many of the results in this literature are limited to settings with independent and homoskedastic data, while data encountered in practice frequently violate these assumptions. We review the literature on weak instruments in linear IV regression with an emphasis on results for nonhomoskedastic (heteroskedastic, serially correlated, or clustered) data. To assess the practical importance of weak instruments, we also report tabulations and simulations based on a survey of papers published in the American Economic Review from 2014 to 2018 that use IV. These results suggest that weak instruments remain an important issue for empirical practice, and that there are simple steps that researchers can take to better handle weak instruments in applications.},

We investigate identification of the average partial effect (APE) when fixed-effect techniques cannot be used to control for the correlation between the regressors and the time-varying disturbances. Relying on control variables, we develop a constructive two-step identification argument. The first step identifies nonparametrically the conditional expectation of the disturbances given the regressors and the control variables, and the second step uses "between-group" variations, correcting for endogeneity, to identify the APE. We propose a natural semiparametric estimator of the APE, show its c n asymptotic normality and compute its asymptotic variance. The estimator is computationally easy to implement, and Monte Carlo simulations show favorable finite sample properties. Control variables arise in various economic and econometric models, and we provide variations of our argument to obtain identification in some applications. As an empirical illustration, we estimate the average elasticity of intertemporal substitution in a labor supply model with random coefficients.},

This formula utilizes cross-sectional information to transform the unit-speciffc (quasi) maximum likelihood estimator into an approximation of the posterior mean under a prior distribution that equals the population distribution of the random coeffcients. We show that the risk of a predictor based on a non-parametric estimate of the Tweedie correction is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of a predictor that treats the correlated-random-effects distribution as known (ratio-optimality).

@article{Steel2020,
	abstract = {The method of model averaging has become an important tool to deal with model uncertainty, for example in situations where a large amount of different theories exist, as are common in economics. Model averaging is a natural and formal response to model uncertainty in a Bayesian framework, and most of the paper deals with Bayesian model averaging. The important role of the prior assumptions in these Bayesian procedures is highlighted. In addition, frequentist model averaging methods are also discussed. Numerical methods to implement these methods are explained, and I point the reader to some freely available computational resources. The main focus is on uncertainty regarding the choice of covariates in normal linear regression models, but the paper also covers other, more challenging, settings, with particular emphasis on sampling models commonly used in economics. Applications of model averaging in economics are reviewed and discussed in a wide range of areas, among which growth economics, production modelling, finance and forecasting macroeconomic quantities.},
