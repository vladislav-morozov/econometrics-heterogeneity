## Exogeneity and Dynamic Models

### Introduction

Throughout the previous section, we assumed that the idiosyncratic term $u_{it}$ satisfied strict exogeneity with respect to the data:
$$
	\E[u_{it}|\bX_i] = 0.
$${#eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality}

However, strict exogeneity is not an innocent assumption. In particular, it implies that for all pairs of indices $t, s$ it holds that 
$$
	\E[u_{it}\bx_{is}] =0.
$$ {#eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality}

If we take $t<s$, @eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality means that  *past* shocks are uncorrelated with *future* values of $\bx$ or, intuitively, that one cannot predict *past* shocks from *future* $\bx$s. 

This requirement might fail if $\bx$ is dynamic and its evolution is affected by $u_{it}$. In this section, we will discuss this challenge and some traditional approaches to dealing with it with short panel data. 

### No Strict Exogeneity for Dynamic Models


A particularly clear example for failure of @eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality arises when $\bx_{it}$ includes lagged values of the outcome. As we show now, strict exogeneity cannot hold in this case. 


For simplicity, we momentarily forget about the cross-sectional dimension consider a simple autoregressive model with 1 lag (AR(1)):
$$
	y_t = \alpha + \lambda y_{t-1} + u_{t},
$$
where  $t=1, \dots, T$ and the innovation $u_t$ satisfies $\E[u_t]=0$. 

 
To show that strict exogeneity fails, it is sufficient to find a single pair of $(t, s)$ such that @eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality  is not true. Specifically, we will take $s=t+1$ and show that  $\E[y_{it+1}u_t]$ is not necessarily zero.

To evaluate this expectation, we write the model at $t+1$
$$
	y_{t+1} = \alpha + \lambda y_t + u_{t+1}.
$$ {#eq-dynamic-interlude-simple-ar1}
We then substitute the model into $\E[y_{it+1}u_t]$
$$
\begin{aligned}
	\E[y_{t+1}u_t] & = \lambda\E[y_t u_t] + \E[u_{t+1}u_t] \\
	&  = \lambda^2\E[y_{t-1}u_t] + \lambda\E[u_t^2] + \E[u_{t+1}u_t] .
\end{aligned}
$$

What can we say about the right hand side? In many contexts, we may reasonably assume that

- One cannot predict the shocks of tomorrow from what you have today, so that $$\E[y_{t-1}u_t]=0.$$
- $u_{t}$ is uncorrelated over time, so that $$\E[u_{t+1}u_t]=0.$$ 

However, $\lambda\E[u_t^2]$ is zero only in two unreasonable cases: 

- If $\lambda=0$, and so the model is not actually dynamic
- $\E[u_t^2]=0$, and so the process is actually fully deterministic. 

Both of these options are unpleasant. The first one goes against the idea of allowing any dynamics. The second is extremely unlikely with any kind of social data. 

### Sequential Exogeneity

So what can you do if you want to allow for dynamic models? Since strict exogeneity ([-@eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality]) is effectively impossible to satisfy, we need a weaker form of exogeneity. 

One popular weaker assumption compatible with dynamic models is *sequential exogeneity* (or *predeterminedness*). In context of the simple univariate time series model ([-@eq-dynamic-interlude-simple-ar1]), sequential exogeneity may be stated as 
$$
		\E[u_{t}| y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \dots] =0.
$$
Intuitively, sequential exogeneity states that future shocks cannot be predicted  using past covariates. However, it does not restrict our ability to predict the past from the future â€” the context which created problems for strict exogeneity. 

More generally, consider a panel data linear model with homogeneous coefficients, a random intercept, and a dynamic process for the outcome:
$$
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{k=1}^K \lambda_k y_{it-k} + \bbeta'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.  
$$ {#eq-dynamic-interlude-dynamic-panel}
In this model, a sequential exogeneity assumption takes form
$$
	 \E[u_{it}|\curl{y_{is-1}, \bx_{is}}_{s\leq t}] =0. 
$$
Model ([-@eq-dynamic-interlude-dynamic-panel]) is a dynamic counterpart of the static model ([-@eq-within-lecture-random-intercept]) we discussed in the last section.

How can you handle  eq-dynamic-interlude-dynamic-panel

As we have seen, 

### Model

For simplicity, we will not include any additional covariates 


### Endogeneity
